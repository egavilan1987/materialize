1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:06,440
You guys welcome to the material I CSSA from scratch with five projects course in this course you learn

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,540
all about them materialized CSSA framework so that you can build really great looking you guys in Web

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,370
sites.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,440
Now this is not a design theory course or anything like that.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,030
After the first section you'll be spending all of your time in a text editor or building things with

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:23,570
this great framework so it's a very hands on course.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,800
Now before taking this course you aren't expected to know anything about materialize.

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,920
We're starting from absolute scratch.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,330
If you do know a little bit about the framework you're going to learn just about everything else.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,240
And if you do already know materialize you've used it before.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,720
We have five real world great looking projects for you to complete.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,460
So even if you wanted to skip the learning sections and go right to the projects you could do that as

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,600
well.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,180
All right so what should you know before taking this course.

15
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,690
Now you should know basic h Tim Allen elenchi ss.

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,280
That's really all you need to know tags and styles basic layout etc..

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,460
You don't technically need to know javascript and Jay Querrey but it will help you a bit because materialise

18
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,790
has a lot of great javascript widgets.

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,620
Now in most cases it's just a matter of initializing them with a line of code and then adding some attributes

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,440
or classes but in some of the projects we'll be writing some custom javascript and Jay Querrey but nothing

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,570
too difficult so if you're not familiar with javascript you'll be just fine.

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,550
OK I'll even learn some.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,480
And then obviously if you do know a framework like bootstrap you'll you you already understand the whole

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,040
scope of what a UI framework is and that can obviously be helpful.

25
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,380
But of course that's not needed.

26
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,450
Now as far as what you will learn you'll learn the entire materialized CSSA framework from start to

27
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,290
finish when it comes to all of the CSSA and Javascript components.

28
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,780
But what do you think is worth even more than that is that you'll learn to structure web pages and you

29
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:57,290
wise and I like to break things into HTML 5 sections and organize them in a way that's easy to understand

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,610
and scale if needed.

31
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,850
So if you wanted to add another section we build it in a way that makes that really easy to do.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:10,770
We'll also be adding some custom javascript and J.A.G. stuff like a basic to do list in our admin team.

33
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,030
We'll have some Google Maps integration things like that.

34
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:20,030
And then in the last project we're going to use SAS which is a CSSA preprocessor that allows us to use

35
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,290
variables and dynamic features in our CSX.

36
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:30,660
OK now as far as the learning career curriculum goes after the intro videos will start on the materialize

37
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,760
sandbox.

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,080
And for those of you that took my bootstrap 4 course it's pretty much the same thing that we did there.

39
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,980
We're going to complete that and we'll move on to our 5 projects and I'll show you a preview of what

40
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,140
those are in a minute.

41
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,690
OK also all the code is included in the course.

42
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,630
Now as far as the sandbox goes what this is is something I put together that is kind of like a custom

43
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,120
learning UI.

44
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,560
It has predefined menu items for each section and some pages have some.

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,290
Some of the core each team already created.

46
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,620
So all we have to do is add the materialized stuff.

47
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:13,970
This really lessens the the painful typing of stuff that you already know and then once this is finished

48
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:19,610
you'll have it to look back on if you need to know when the class names or how to initialize the carousel

49
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,780
anything like that.

50
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,090
You'll have this really good resource to look back on.

51
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,170
All right so once that's done we're going to move on to our first project which is called Travel ville

52
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,660
and it's basically a theme for a travel agency that uses the carousel slider.

53
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,140
It uses auto complete card's icons and a bunch of other stuff.

54
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,590
And as you can see all projects are completely responsive and they all look great on mobile devices

55
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,590
as well.

56
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,150
OK next we have a theme called KwaZulu which is a cloud hosting theme.

57
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:57,620
I got the idea for this from Heroku although it's not nearly as in-depth but the color scheme is similar

58
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,080
as well as the content.

59
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:04,520
Ok this theme will have three separate pages rather than just one landing page.

60
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:11,150
We'll also use a carousel slider for the testimonial sections and tabs in the solution pages and some

61
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,740
other stuff.

62
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:18,680
Next we're going to build an admin theme called Mad Men or material admin and this is our most interactive

63
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,900
project as far as the javascript and Jay Querrey we're actually going to have these numbers here.

64
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,380
Count from 0 up.

65
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,120
They're going to animate.

66
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,690
We're also going to have we're going to add a simple chart here.

67
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,240
So this is from canvas J.S..

68
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,770
We're just going to add some dummy data here.

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,480
We're also going to make this to do lists.

70
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,680
You can't really see it down here but it's a quick to do list.

71
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,510
We're going to make this function so we'll be able to add to Dewes and delete them and so on.

72
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,280
We're going to use modals we're also have a preload or so that it takes one second for each page to

73
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,640
load and it'll show the little spin or graphic.

74
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,180
So it's going to be a very interactive project.

75
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,660
All right so the next one is going to be a full screen landing page called biz land which is a business

76
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:10,020
consulting theme will be using scroll spy so that we can just click on a link here and it will basically

77
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,640
animate us down to the section that we want.

78
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,620
We'll also be using a Google map for the background under the contact form and then the last project

79
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,590
called Gallop's is going to be a graphic design portfolio and we're going to be using SAS with this

80
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,510
project.

81
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,730
OK we're going to compile our SAS with a goofy tool called Koala.

82
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:37,020
We're also going to use scroll fire which will allow us to scroll down and we'll have each project here

83
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,020
appear as we scroll down.

84
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,390
All right guys so I really hope you enjoy this course.

85
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:47,490
I put a lot of time and effort into the projects I wanted to create themes that looked professional

86
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,240
and looked like something that you would really create for a client.

87
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,100
All right so let's jump in and get started in the next video I just want to take a little bit of time

88
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,480
to talk about exactly what materialize CSSA is as well as what material design is.

89
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,840
OK so I will see you in the next lecture.
