00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,150
Hey guys this video we're going to talk about what materialize CSSA is and why you'd want to learn and

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,850
use it.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,080
So materializes a modern UI framework or a front end framework that's strongly based on Google's material

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,350
design concept which I'll talk about in the next slide.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,530
It's similar to frameworks like bootstrap and foundation and as many of you know I do have a course

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,470
on bootstrap 4 which is a great framework it's the most popular by far but materialize is getting up

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,920
there in popularity because of its clean look and its interactive components materialize uses much more

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,060
motion and user and interactivity than other frameworks.

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,350
And that's one of the principles of material design.

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,240
It's also extremely customizable as far as colors and look you don't just have like a set of five or

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,350
six colors you can use just about any color along with different scales of lightening or darkening.

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,670
So you're not stuck with a framework where everyone can tell exactly what it is.

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,870
It allows you to be very creative and unique in your themes and interfaces.

14
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,210
All right so what is material design.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:12,760
It is a design language or scheme that was created by Google back in 2014.

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,990
It makes very liberal use of grid layouts responsive animations shadows and a bunch of bunch of other

17
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,700
concepts that you'll notice throughout the course.

18
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,990
It's based on an expandable paper and ink looks so it's supposed to sort of reflect physical surfaces

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,870
and edges with shadows and almost 3-D real life look.

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,390
And if you look at most of the Google based you guys like G-mail the new YouTube style Google Drive

21
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,110
they all use material design concepts.

22
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,440
All right.

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,820
So let's talk a little bit about why you would want to learn materialize why you'd want to use it.

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,690
So I would say that the the overall reason to use materialize or learn it is that it gives you a tool

25
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:00,480
for being able to quickly create beautiful Web sites and application interfaces without having to have

26
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,060
a lot of design skill.

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,860
A lot of us are just developers and we don't really have that knack or that eye for design and materialize

28
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,980
gives us the option to create nice interfaces without hiring a designer.

29
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,720
Now we are getting some new features of CSSA like the grid and you'll hear some developers say things

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,590
like well why use a framework now with CSSA grid available and that that statement actually really baffles

31
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,160
me.

32
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,720
For two reasons One is because the SS grid is very new and it isn't compatible with every browser.

33
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,620
And the more important reason is because materialize and other frameworks like bootstrap are much much

34
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,260
more than just a grid.

35
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,350
Yes you could use siestas grid for making columns but that said.

36
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:50,700
What about the nav bar buttons pagination styling the cards the colors the javascript widgets the grid

37
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:57,540
system is just a tiny part of this framework and materialize allows you to not have to worry about styling

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,370
all your individual elements yourself and making everything responsive on your own which is just invaluable.

39
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,080
OK it's 100 percent responsive by design so you don't have to write your own media queries.

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,380
You also get tons of CSSA and Javascript components with things like animations and transitions.

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:24,800
So comparing CSSA grid to a framework like materialize is is basically just apples to oranges.

42
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,570
All right so let's talk a little bit about versions.

43
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,260
This can be a complicated issue with any course.

44
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,670
We as instructors have to always be aware of updates and breaking changes.

45
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,950
So in this course we're going to be using the version of materialized that's available at the official

46
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:48,270
site of materialise CSSA dot com which is right now version zero point one hundred point two.

47
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:55,740
Now 1.0 is in Alpha at next stop materialized dot com and as soon as that's released and put on the

48
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,650
main site the course will be updated accordingly.

49
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:04,470
OK now if you go and look at the Alpha docs there is not many changes in terms of class names and features

50
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,640
and stuff like that.

51
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,310
So you don't have to worry about everything changing into something that's unrecognizable to what you've

52
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,200
learned.

53
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,820
And for the changes that do happen the course will be updated.

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,690
This course will always use whatever is offered and recommended by the official Web site.

55
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,060
All right guys so that's it.

56
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:28,380
In the next video we're going to jump in and set up our text editor which will be visual studio code.

57
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,690
But of course you can use whatever you want.

58
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,200
So I will see you in the next lecture.
