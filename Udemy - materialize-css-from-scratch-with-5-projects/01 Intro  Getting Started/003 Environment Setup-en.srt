1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,660
All right so we're going to go ahead and set up our environment now since this is a front end course

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:10,050
so we don't need any databases or anything difficult like that in this video we're just setting up a

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,720
text editor and we're going to be using Visual Studio code for this course.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,940
Now you don't have to use VS code if you want to use atom or Sublime Text or web storm or some other

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,460
editor that's absolutely fine.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:30,300
But if you want to follow along to a T then I would suggest using VS code along with the couple of extensions

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,610
that I'm going to install as well.

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,110
All right so you can go to cocotte Visual Studio dot com and just download it.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,120
It is completely cross-platform so it doesn't matter if you're on Windows Mac or Linux.

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,550
Ok I already have it downloaded so I'm just going to go ahead and open the windows cause I'm going to

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:56,740
open up the setup file and we're just going to go through the install a real quick.

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,050
I already had installed at one point so I guess I already had the folder created but we're just going

13
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:02,830
to click next.

14
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,030
Now you want to choose these two options right here.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,170
This is going to make it so that when you right click a folder or a file you'll be able to open it with

16
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,600
Visual Studio code which is pretty handy right.

17
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,790
So just get that set up OK so that's all set.

18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,850
Let's go ahead and watch visuals to your code.

19
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:32,550
And you should see your welcome page here I'm just going to close that up and what I want to do first.

20
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,630
Basically I want to set up a couple settings a couple of preferences and then install a couple extensions.

21
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:45,890
So let's first go to File preferences settings or hit Control comma or command comma and basically the

22
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:52,490
settings file is one big case file so they're just key value pairs of different categories.

23
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,410
There's only a couple of things that I want to change.

24
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,090
One is my font size so that you guys can see this better.

25
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,200
So to change a setting you'll see it says Ed. font size 14.

26
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,760
I'm going to click the little pencil icon and say copy to settings and what it will do is move it over

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:14,120
here to the custom area where we can actually edit it so I'm going to change it to 26 and hit Control

28
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,980
s or command.

29
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,600
If you're on a Mac and it'll save it automatically and you can see it kicks in.

30
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:26,090
All right so another thing I want to change is my tab size so I'm going to click the little pencil icon

31
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:32,930
and change it from 4 to 2 so that way our code isn't so spread out and then I also want to turn on word

32
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,600
wrap so I'm going to search for the word wrap in the search bar and you can see added or word wrap is

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,170
off.

34
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:45,860
I'm going to go ahead and set that to on and just click click save and retry and then it puts it over

35
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,900
here and turns it on.

36
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,320
All right so let's go ahead and save that control ass and close out.

37
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,900
And now we're going to install a couple of extensions so we're going to click this icon at the bottom

38
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,440
here.

39
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,910
This is where you can search for extensions and so on.

40
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:08,300
So we basically want two extensions One is live server which is right here so when I click the little

41
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:15,380
green install button and it'll install and this is so that we can take in each HTML file and we can

42
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,400
open it on our local host rather than on our file system.

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,950
And it also gives us autoload functionality so as soon as we save it will update and I won't have to

44
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,140
keep reloading it.

45
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,040
It's very very helpful.

46
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,620
So once it's installed you just want to click this reload button and it reloads your editor.

47
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,290
All right the next thing I want to install is prettier.

48
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:42,530
So we're going to search for prettier and prettier as a code formatter and basically what I want to

49
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,960
do is configure it so that it will fix things on save.

50
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,030
OK so if we for instance if we're missing a semi-colon in our CSSA if we save it will automatically

51
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,650
at it and it will also format our code nice and neat.

52
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,700
That way all everyone's code will match and it just makes things much easier.

53
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,110
So we're going to install that

54
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,690
and you can see it's quite popular there's $1 million downloads

55
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,430
OK so once that's installed you just want to click reload again.

56
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,530
And then those are the only two extensions that we need at least for now.

57
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:32,930
So next thing I want to do is go back to my settings or preferences or preferences settings and we need

58
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:42,860
in order for prettier to auto save or auto edits are correct when we save we need to search for.

59
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,480
Let's see what it is it's I believe it's format on save.

60
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,080
So search for format right here edit or format on save as set defaults.

61
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,540
I'm going to go ahead and set that to true so it gets put over here and we'll save that with control

62
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,030
or command us.

63
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:07,890
And then the other thing that I want to change I'm going to search for prettier and we want.

64
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,100
Well actually this is completely optional.

65
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,910
I prefer single quotes in my javascript.

66
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:18,290
We will be doing a little bit of Javascript and if I do if we don't change this all single quotes will

67
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,900
turn to double quotes.

68
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,380
So this right here pretty or single quote.

69
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,760
I'm going to set to True but it's completely up to you if you want to use that or not.

70
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,970
OK I'm going to save.

71
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,380
And that looks good so go ahead and close this up.

72
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,500
And that should be all the settings we need for now.

73
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,480
So now I want to do is just test a couple of things out.

74
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,590
I'm going to just create an on each team I'll file right on my desk top.

75
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,930
You don't have to save this.

76
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,810
You don't have to keep this or anything.

77
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,990
It's not going to be in the files it's just a test some things.

78
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:58,220
So we're going to say open with code you should have that if you chose those two options in the beginning.

79
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,930
All right so we're in the index each time I'll file.

80
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,690
Now another thing I want to mention is Emmett.

81
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,380
So it is just a fantastic program.

82
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:14,150
It's it's a it's an extension for most editors but it's included by default with the code so it's not

83
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,330
something we have to install it's already here.

84
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:23,170
But if you're using atom or Sublime Text or something like that I would highly suggest installing it.

85
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,220
It allows us to do things like put in an exclamation and hit tab.

86
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:33,290
And it gives us basically just head body tags a whole each time I lay out if we want to do tags like

87
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:40,160
let's say in H-1 we could just do H-1 tab it'll give us a beginning and ending H-1 if we wanted to add

88
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:48,110
an ID we could do hash lets say test tab it'll give us an idea of test if we wanted a class we could

89
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,870
do Daut test or whatever we want the class name and it'll give us that class.

90
00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:00,710
Now if we want a div we could do div dot tests for a class of test but we don't even need to put the

91
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:07,220
word div if if that's what we want we can just do dot test tab and it will give us a div with the class

92
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:07,720
of test.

93
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,570
Same thing with ID if we wanted an idea of test we could go ahead and do that.

94
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,010
So Emmon is very very helpful.

95
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,890
We could do things like let's say we wanted 10 allys we could do ally times 10 and tab and that gives

96
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:28,070
us 10 allys it's just it really makes things much easier and I'd highly recommend it if you're not already

97
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,970
using it.

98
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:34,010
And I will be using it throughout the course so I wanted to show you that so that you don't get confused

99
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,870
when you see me doing things like that.

100
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,290
OK another thing I wanted to do is just test out the live server so I'll just put an H-1 in here and

101
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,350
just say hello world and save.

102
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:53,420
And then if you install life server you should be able to right click and say open with live server

103
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,300
and you can see that it opens our file up.

104
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,100
So I'm just going to snap these over.

105
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:07,010
Now notice that the in the U R L bar it's at our loopback address which is 1 2 7 0 0 1 that's your local

106
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:11,040
host and it's on port 5500 by default.

107
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,440
All right.

108
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,820
Now what's nice about this is that if I change something here if I change this to.

109
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:22,310
Hello there and just save it automatically reloads I don't have to keep reloading it.

110
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,320
So that's really nice.

111
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,650
All right.

112
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,120
So I would highly recommend that you use something like this.

113
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:35,250
Most most braue are text editors have something like this for instance Adam has Adam live server.

114
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,950
It just makes things much easier and more efficient.

115
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,820
All right so that's all I wanted to do.

116
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,850
Now that we have everything set up on do you want to stop the server you can see right down here where

117
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,690
it says port 5500.

118
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,600
Just click that and that'll stop the server.

119
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,220
OK.

120
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,930
And if I reload now it won't work.

121
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,050
So in the next video what I want to do is start to set up our sandbox so we're going to have a bunch

122
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,910
of files I already pre-made that are ready to go and ready to start.

123
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:14,430
Learn start looking at the syntax for materialize the classes the javascript components all that stuff.

124
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,170
So we'll get into setting that up in the next video.
