1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,560
All right guys so before we move on to the next section and get to work on MacIan dematerialize framework.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:14,100
I just want you to set up the sandbox OK so the sandbox is a collection of HTL files that we have one

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,920
for each section and each I'm sorry one for each lecturer and each lecturer will cover a certain aspect.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,820
So for instance Section 2 Lecture 1 is on typography and you can see the file name here to one typography

5
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,760
daughter each team now and we have things like headings paragraphs block quotes stuff we're going to

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,270
go over we're going to add some materialize markup some classes and talk about it.

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,710
That will be one lecture and then the next one will be on text and background colors.

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,980
You can see the name of this file is to underscore two colors on each team.

9
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,940
And we look at the different colors the dark and then light and classes things like that.

10
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,800
So for each lecture will have a different page that we're going to edit and look at the classes and

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,820
so on.

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,040
All right so section 2 and 3 will be on CSSA components.

13
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,120
So things like cards and tables and forms things like that.

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:17,070
And then four and five will be on javascript's So for instance the carousel will look at the collapsible

15
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,060
tabs things like that Parallax so different different javascript features.

16
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,820
So this is basically the end result of the sandbox.

17
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:31,540
OK and this will be included in your in this particular lecture's files.

18
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,910
But what's really important is the starter version of it.

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,180
So you'll have a zip file called materialize sandbox starter.

20
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,980
That's what you want to download.

21
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:46,740
All right I have it right here the zip files so what I want you to do is create a folder somewhere on

22
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:56,220
your computer and just call it materialize underscore sandbox OK and open that empty folder.

23
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,630
And then we're going to take all the files from the start of version.

24
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,040
OK.

25
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:07,870
So it should look like this are going to grab everything here and just bring it over all right now this

26
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,070
is your sandbox to work with for the next few sections.

27
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,310
So what I'm going to do is just open this with the code which is the text editor I'm using.

28
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,570
Feel free to use any other text editor I would suggest having the files on the side here though.

29
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,280
All right so let's quickly take a look at the structure.

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,280
So like I said we have an HMO file basically for every lecture for the next four sections.

31
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:39,530
And if we look at the folders here we have a local version of materialized CSX.

32
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,890
At this time we're using version zero point one hundred point two which is the latest from materialise

33
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,690
CSSA dot com.

34
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,960
Now Version 1 is in alpha and at some point that will be stable.

35
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,300
When that happens this course will be updated updated very soon after that.

36
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:04,330
But for now no matter what the latest version is I would suggest using the version that comes in the

37
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,230
sandbox just so you don't run into any issues.

38
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,080
And then the course will be updated later on.

39
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:17,230
OK we also have just a style CSSA And in case we need any extra styles but I don't I don't think we

40
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:24,050
actually do need that Faunce that's just the folder for the fonts that comes with materialized.

41
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,410
If I were to go to materialize CSSA dot com and download the package this is what we get.

42
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:36,970
OK excluding the images the images are something that I added for cards and things like that so we just

43
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,790
have some high quality images to work with.

44
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,690
OK in the javascript folder we just have the general materialized in a file javascript.

45
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,200
We're obviously not going to touch this file.

46
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,140
We just need to include it for any javascript.

47
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,780
OK we also need to include Jey query but we're going to use a CDN for that.

48
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,400
So to look at one of these files they're all basically formatted the same as far as like the head.

49
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:10,120
Things like that we're in we're bringing in the material Icahn's library materialise has its own icon

50
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,100
library.

51
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,620
We're bringing that in from Google API eyes.

52
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,850
We're also importing the material I CSSA file from the local version that we have in the CSSA folder.

53
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,950
We're importing the styles CSSA file.

54
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,260
We have a viewport for responsiveness and mobile devices.

55
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,270
And then down here we just have the title of the of whatever the lecturer is.

56
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,100
OK you're not going to touch any of this.

57
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,570
This is just the title.

58
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,320
And then this is the menu.

59
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,360
OK so this is that menu you saw with all the different links to the different lectures.

60
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,920
So what you want to do is go down to where it says start here.

61
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:54,040
OK nothing above start here do you need to touch ok unless we're specifically adding something maybe

62
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,390
in a style or something like that above.

63
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,600
But generally you're going to want to just scroll down to where it says Start here and then down here

64
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,560
you'll see it says.

65
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,310
And here I should put some spaces in there.

66
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,670
OK so we'll be working with everything in between.

67
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,170
And some things like headings.

68
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,280
You'll see there's nothing here we'll just start from scratch and put in our headings.

69
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,290
Some things actually have some.

70
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,130
Some tags and content and we'll just add our classes and so on.

71
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,940
So you can learn about all the different classes.

72
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:31,480
All right and then down at the bottom we just have a query included are materialized javascript and

73
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,610
oh this test right here.

74
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,840
That won't be there for your version.

75
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,790
That was just something I was testing out.

76
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,610
And then here is where we're just initializing the dropdown menu.

77
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:49,900
So you don't have to worry about this now in some in some lectures we will have to add some javascript

78
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,100
especially for 4 and 5 sections 4 and 5.

79
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,990
So that's where we'll add javascript down here.

80
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,080
So we have javascript's start here.

81
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:05,890
So I tried to lay it out in a very simple way that's understandable and if we look at the next file

82
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,570
you'll see it's very similar.

83
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,080
If we go down after the menu it's start here and this is where we'll be working.

84
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,470
All right.

85
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,970
And down here you can see if we have some javascript to add will put it down here.

86
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,180
OK.

87
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,500
So that's all I'll be doing.

88
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,160
Guys this is how the next four sections are going to work.

89
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,560
Once we get through the sandbox we're going to start to build some real projects or I'd.

90
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:35,320
But I'm doing the sandbox will really teach you what's available with materialize as well as get you

91
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:42,370
familiar with the syntax with the classes with what we can do with javascript initialization things

92
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,150
like that.

93
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,640
OK so in the next section we're going to start.

94
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,830
And we're going to get into basic typography alignment things like that.

95
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,460
So I will see you in the next video.
