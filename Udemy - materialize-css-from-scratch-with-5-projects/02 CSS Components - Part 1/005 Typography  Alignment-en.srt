1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,960
All right guys in this video we're going to start to talk about typography and alignment things like

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,690
that things to do with text.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:15,570
So in the material I sandbox I'm going to open up to underscore one to biography and we're going to

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,380
go to the top here.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,280
Now like I said we're going to start where it's a start here in most cases.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:29,460
But just for this one file I want to take a look at the container because everything in the sandbox

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,750
files is wrapped inside of a container class.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,300
OK.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,300
Now if you've ever worked with bootstrap or most other frameworks there's a container class which gives

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,250
your content that is within it.

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,270
It gives it a with usually a flexible with.

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,080
And it gives it margin auto and pushes basically pushes it into the middle and add spacing.

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,790
So let's open up this file I'm going to use open.

14
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,390
I'm going to use live server.

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,660
So when I say open with a live server but of course you can just open it on your file system or you

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,890
can use another server or however you want to open it just get it open.

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:05,830
All right.

18
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,300
Now as you can see there's spacing on the sides here.

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,940
Even if I were to make this bigger you'll see up to a certain point then it just stays at that with.

20
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,880
And I think the max with this 12 80.

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,230
So let's actually take a look.

22
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:28,170
If we open up our chrome tools here and we go to the container and we look over here you see that we

23
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,040
have a media query for the men with 993 pixels.

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,240
And at this stage at this screen size the width of the container is 70 percent.

25
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,810
If I were to make this smaller let's put it back to where we had it.

26
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,620
And look at the container.

27
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:51,970
Now it's 85 percent OK so that with is going to change based on these media queries.

28
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,170
And if we look down here the max with is 12 80 pixels so no matter how big your browser is that's the

29
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,750
max with It'll be ok it also has that margin.

30
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,660
Auto.

31
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,610
So that's the container.

32
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:11,610
And let's go down here now where it says Start here and we're going to start to look at some headings

33
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,590
and paragraphs and stuff like that so I'm going to put in an H1 here.

34
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,840
Actually I'm going to put in the heading of each size just so we can see what they look like.

35
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,670
So that will be heading to an amusing Amet here.

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:46,380
Each drive will be heading five and age 6 having sex or let's save that and see what we got.

37
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,060
So these are what the headings look like.

38
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,630
Now there's really no special classes in the materialized framework for headings for instance bootstrap

39
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,540
4 has the display one display two headings.

40
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:05,310
There's none of that materialized you just basically have ones one version of a heading and you can

41
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,400
add color classes but we'll get into that in the next video.

42
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,100
So let's take a look at the CSSA Ford H-1.

43
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:20,290
So if I just go ahead and inspect the each one you'll see you have a font sizes of four point two RAM.

44
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,950
Now a RAM unit if you don't know is a relative measurement in CSSA.

45
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,520
Basically one RAM is equal to the amount of pixels of the root h t m l element.

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:39,690
So if we go ahead and look at that and see what that is we'll go to the h l element and you see as a

47
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:48,230
font size of 14 pixels so in materialize if we use the unit 1 REM then we're using 14 pixels.

48
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,860
Now where the heading is four point two RAM.

49
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:59,490
It's going to be 4.2 times 14 pixels and that will be the amount of pixels so we can actually see that

50
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:06,450
under computed in the chrome tools if I were to go down here and you see that the actual size in pixels

51
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,310
is fifty eight point eight pixels.

52
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:18,810
Ok heading to is forty nine point eighty four pixels which is if we go back to Styles three point five

53
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:26,640
six ram OK and then every heading has a line height of 110 percent and it has these margins which are

54
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,260
also in RAM units.

55
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:34,890
OK one of the feedbacks that I got on my bootstrap course where we did the same thing we set up a sandbox

56
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:42,710
is some people said that I was just adding classes and not really talking about what they did.

57
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,900
So in this course I'm going to look more into the CSSA and actually see what it's doing OK but I don't

58
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,180
want to do that too too much because I think it will just take up a ton of time if we see every single

59
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,920
style for every single element in class.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,680
But I will be doing it more often than I did in the bootstrap corps.

61
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,850
All right so now for a paragraph we're going to go ahead and just add a simple paragraph.

62
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,780
If we're using it you can just do Lorem you could do the word larm and then a number.

63
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,070
So let's say 20 and then tab and that will give me 20 words of sample text.

64
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,880
So if I save that you can see that this is the paragraph I just added and that's just what the standard

65
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,960
paragraph looks like and materialize.

66
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:33,520
And if we look at the see SS Basically it's just displayed as a block.

67
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,030
Not too much not too much style on a paragraph.

68
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,100
Nothing really special.

69
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,720
Now for a block quote Let's go ahead and add that.

70
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,440
So I'll go down here and we'll put in a block quote.

71
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,490
Whoops.

72
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,740
You know what caps will do.

73
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,780
Warm 10 tablets would give us 10 words and save.

74
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,990
And then this is what a block quote looks like.

75
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,320
So it basically gives you this red line.

76
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,880
This border on the left and it gives you some padding between attacks.

77
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,410
OK.

78
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,450
Looks like the text size is the same as a paragraph.

79
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,850
So that's a block quote.

80
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:19,450
Now in addition to just the standard paragraph we have a flow text paragraph so we can use this with

81
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:27,670
the class of flow dash text and save and you can see it does a couple of things one it makes the text

82
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,640
bigger.

83
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:36,620
So if we were to look at the font size you'll see it as a font size of 1.3 9 to ram.

84
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:42,830
Now that said this screen size flow text makes it so that this is completely responsive this text if

85
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,360
I make this bigger you'll see that text actually gets bigger.

86
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:52,270
So now if we look it is one way to change 1.6 a ram.

87
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:52,840
Yeah.

88
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,560
Now if we go down here it's 1.4 that it's 1.3.

89
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:03,950
So it changes based on the screen size or the device size which is really cool.

90
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,190
All right so that's what flow text does.

91
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,100
So now what I want to do is look at alignment.

92
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,170
We have these three H fives here I want to align them so we're going to add the first one we'll have

93
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:23,630
a class of line dash left and if I save there's going to be no difference because it's already aligned

94
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,910
to the left.

95
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:33,440
This one here lets out a class of a line right and save and that did nothing.

96
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,780
Let's see.

97
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,950
That's because it's supposed to be left align and right line not aligned left and right left.

98
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:53,340
Right so the write right align and save and you can see now that's lined to the right and for this 8:5

99
00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:01,880
here let's do class and let's do center line and save and now that's aligned to the center.

100
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,420
Now vertical alignment.

101
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,610
What I'm going to do is this div that wraps to each five.

102
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:13,770
I'm just going to give an inline style and I'm going to give it a height of let's say 400 pixels and

103
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,460
then just a light gray background.

104
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:18,780
OK.

105
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,990
And then if I save that is see that it gives it the 400 pixels.

106
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,920
And what I want to do is I want this text to be in the middle vertically.

107
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,520
So what we would do is we would add a class not to the H5 but to the wrapper.

108
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:38,830
OK so there's actually a class called V a line dash wrapper.

109
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:45,810
And if I save that it'll move it down it'll center it vertically OK which can be helpful.

110
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,310
We also have quick floats.

111
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:56,110
So if we would just want to align to the right or left or real quick we can say class equals two left.

112
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,230
And then for this paragraph will do.

113
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,540
Class equals right.

114
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:09,690
Now if I say that it's going to look weird because what's happening is we're not clearing our floats.

115
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:19,080
So to do that we need to put a div here which I have and we're going to add a class of clear fix a just

116
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,750
like bootstrap if you're familiar with bootstrap and I'll be making references to bootstrap because

117
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:31,770
I'm sure a lot of you already know that framework just because it's so big and popular so it's save.

118
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,540
And now you can see that the floats are being cleared.

119
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:41,510
All right so I think that's going to do it for alignment and typography and stuff like that.

120
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,730
Notice that I can scroll down more that's because with some of these pages I just put this margin top

121
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,170
five hundred pixels.

122
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,570
That way you know you guys don't have to look at the bottom of the screen because that's what was happening.

123
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:00,320
So I decided to put that there so that I could put stuff in the middle even if it's at the bottom.

124
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:00,660
All right.

125
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,900
So the next video we're going to get started on text background colors.

126
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,370
OK.

127
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,300
Or I should say text colors and background colors.
