1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,420
All right in this video we're going to take a look at collar's So that's one thing that materializes

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,550
is really good with colors are so many to choose from.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,070
There's different shades of colors we can use and this is for text as well as background colors for

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,050
just about any element.

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,180
All right so what I have is just a bunch of paragraphs they all they all the same dummy text inside

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,400
of them and we're going to look at some of the color classes.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,040
Now first thing we'll look at is text colors.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:34,590
OK so for text colors we're going to give these classes of a color name so let's say red and then dash

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,460
text.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,280
So if I go ahead and save that you'll see that that is now read text.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:40,680
All right.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:49,430
So let's add some other colors here so I'll say class equals and let's do blue dash text.

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:58,010
All right so for this one let's say we'll do orange dash.

14
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,840
TEXT

15
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,440
And it's two green text

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,610
yellow.

17
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,060
So these are kind of the standard colors are the just the more common colors.

18
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,440
There's some other ones as well that aren't so common that I'll show you in a minute.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,060
So we have purple

20
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,120
and many frameworks just have like four or five colors there's just a ton with materialize so we have

21
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,080
pink

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,430
and we have gray.

23
00:01:47,650 --> 00:02:01,700
And for this one here it's two brown text and we also have white text.

24
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,610
All right.

25
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,280
So let's go ahead and save that and you can see all these different colors.

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,890
We have the white text you can't see because it's on a white background.

27
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,810
But if you have a dark background color you're going to want to use white text.

28
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,280
Ok so we also have some less common colors.

29
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,870
So one of these

30
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,330
is Deep Purple.

31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:32,470
So if we say deep Dasch purple Dasch text and say You see it's kind of a different purple than this

32
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,480
one here.

33
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:43,690
And we also have indigo so I'll say Indigo Dasch text and save and that gives us kind of a different

34
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:49,840
color purple or Indigo of cyan.

35
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,920
So science texts we have teal

36
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,220
Teall text

37
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,220
we have lime

38
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:15,760
we have Amber dash texts and we can do like green

39
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,880
if we got the class there.

40
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,630
And then for this paragraph here let's do deep orange

41
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,450
and then for this final one we're going to do a blue gray.

42
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,590
So blue the gray dash text.

43
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:59,140
So save that and I can see we have a whole nother group of less common colors I call them.

44
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:06,570
OK so if you want to look more into the different colors if you go to the materialize documentation

45
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,280
let's see it's click on this and go to I think it's CSSA color.

46
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,460
And you see all the different color palette.

47
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,050
So we have red paint.

48
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,960
So these are just basically all the colors reviews purple deep purple blue.

49
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:31,550
I'm pretty sure I used all of them cyan of light blue and then use that

50
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,840
green we use that lime so all the different color palettes and we're going to get into the different

51
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,200
shades as well but white and red.

52
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,860
Now what I want to do is look at background colors.

53
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:51,230
So what I'll do is copy all the standard colored paragraphs and I'm going to go down here and I'm just

54
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,220
going to replace this here.

55
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,300
All these paragraphs and then just remove the word text

56
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,640
OK and what that does is it makes the background that color not the text.

57
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,760
If you want the text color then you need to include just dash text.

58
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:18,790
If not it'll do the background so let's go back and save and I can see we have our background colors.

59
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,320
All right.

60
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:26,470
Now there is some padding to these paragraphs because for this file I just added a style of five pixel

61
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,230
padding.

62
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,910
If we didn't have this then we wouldn't have as much space around the graph.

63
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:37,360
But I figured that adding that may makes it look a little better and you can see the color a little

64
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,010
better.

65
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,820
All right so that's how we can add the background colors.

66
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:48,970
Now if you have for instance let's say this purple background you probably are probably going to want

67
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,500
white text on that.

68
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:58,260
So we could go ahead and also add the class of white dash text and save and now we have white text.

69
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:58,570
All right.

70
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,880
And you can do any color text save for this yellow.

71
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,060
We wanted to do green tax which will look really ugly but we can do it.

72
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,200
OK.

73
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:15,610
And then we also have our less common colors backgrounds so what I'll do is copy those and we'll just

74
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:23,500
replace these standard paragraphs and just remove the word text from all of these so I'll go ahead and

75
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:31,030
use some vias code magic I can do I can do control D-NV s code it'll just select all of those and I'll

76
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,780
just delete them.

77
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,540
All right so I'll save that.

78
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:39,720
And now we have our background colors with these less calming colors.

79
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:43,300
All right so now let's take a look at Darkon and Litan.

80
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:50,520
So let's take this first paragraph and let's add a class of red and save.

81
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,050
All right so it gives us a red background.

82
00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:02,860
Now we have different levels of Darkon enlightened so I'm going to go ahead and say Darkon actually

83
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,400
I'll leave this one at red so we can see the difference.

84
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:14,160
But then this next one here I'm going to add a class of red again and then dark and Dash 1.

85
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:18,790
All right so if I save that you'll see that it's slightly darker than the regular red.

86
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:27,980
And then for this one will again say red and will say dark and Dash 2 for this one let's say red whoops

87
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,200
we need a class.

88
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,690
So will save red and dark and dash 3.

89
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,070
And it goes up to four.

90
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:42,670
So this one will be red and dark and dash four and save.

91
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,500
And I can see it just gets darker as it goes up as the number goes up.

92
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,350
And at the same time we have lightening noon so I'm going to just copy all of these and go ahead and

93
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:59,470
paste these here and I'm just going to change the dark and so again I'll do control d to select all

94
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:07,150
these darkens and change them to lighten and save and I can see that they get progressively lighter

95
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,140
as the number goes up.

96
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,280
OK so that's it for colors.

97
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:18,220
Guys we have a lot of options so you can add colors to buttons to divs paragraphs anything at all.

98
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,110
All right so I will see you in the next video.
