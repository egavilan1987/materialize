1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,360
All right in this video we're going to take a look at Buttons.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,410
OK so we have quite a bit of options when it comes to buttons right here.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,570
I'll go to.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,950
We're it's a start here.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,470
It's a standard button in the two three buttons icons each time I'll file.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,740
And see I have it loaded here under this menu item.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:25,620
And what I'm going to do is add to this button tag a class of just between.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,310
OK so let's save that.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:34,440
Now this is what basically a standard materialise button looks like and we can add this to a button

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,630
as well as a link tags so we can see a class Button here as well.

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,940
And it'll basically look the same.

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,790
OK.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:52,660
Now we also have a cool waves effect with materialize so for you are to give this a class can't I.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,660
So a class of BGN.

15
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,340
And then we can do waves dash effect.

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,800
And we're going to see waves dash light and let's save that.

17
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:13,810
And now if I go to a regular button and I click look you'll see that nothing really happens if I click

18
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,130
the waves you can see the little effect that it gives us.

19
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,110
OK and we can do this on a button or a link.

20
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:26,550
So if I just grab this class and put it on this link you'll see it does the same thing.

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:26,830
All right.

22
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,060
Now we also can add different colors to these waves so what we're going to do is I'm going to add a

23
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:38,500
class of white K for that for this button here for all of these buttons.

24
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,920
We also need to be T.N. class which gives it all its padding and stuff.

25
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:48,530
And then let's make the text I will say read Desch text.

26
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,400
Ok so this is all stuff that we've already learned all the color stuff.

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:02:02,690
And then I'm also going to say waves dash effect and then lets say waves dash red.

28
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:08,450
OK so now if I go to this button and click you'll see that we get the red wave.

29
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:08,740
All right.

30
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,450
Now just to make this a little shorter.

31
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,970
Let's go ahead and just paste this in.

32
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,290
What is it for so.

33
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:23,820
One two three four and we'll just change up the colors so we'll say let's do T.L. and then we'll change

34
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:29,760
the waves to waves dash T.L. and your text doesn't have to match the color.

35
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,270
But I think it looks nice when it does.

36
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:44,970
Let's do green and we'll say green text and then for this one let's do you know let's do grey text but

37
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,860
we'll do a yellow wave

38
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,050
and then for this last one wants to purple.

39
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:04,400
So will say purple Tex and let's say waves dash purple and we'll save and now each one that I click

40
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,250
you can see that it has a different color wave effects.

41
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,520
That's pretty cool.

42
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,750
Now we can also have icons very do this material icons library.

43
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,160
You do have to include it.

44
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,900
You can see appear in the head.

45
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,110
I'm including it.

46
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,890
What I've also done in this file is include the font.

47
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:27,770
Awesome CDN which is another icon library because I want to show you that you can use those as well

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,550
if you prefer font.

49
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,920
Austin does have a lot more choices than the material icons.

50
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,210
All right.

51
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,000
So let's go right here and let's see.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:48,920
To add an icon we're going to use an eye tag and we're going to give it a class of material dash icons.

53
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,030
So this is how it works.

54
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:56,300
Every icon gets a class of material icons and then the specific icon you want.

55
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:03,590
You put that in here the identifier so let's say I want a shopping cart icon and I'll say shopping underscore

56
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,970
cart and save and it gives me that icon.

57
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:12,020
And if you want to check all of these though I forget the exact you R-AL but will see him with Tiriel

58
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,870
icons.

59
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,200
And yeah it's material Daut IO slash icons.

60
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:25,340
And down here you'll see all of the different things that you can add so it's look for shopping cart

61
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,040
Let's see where is it's big area here.

62
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:41,860
So if I click shopping cart an icon for Aunt right here shows us how to use it.

63
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,870
I class material icons and then shopping under score card so you can check this site if you want to

64
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,400
check out the different icons that are available.

65
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,400
Now what I'll do is let's let's copy a couple of these down so we'll do one two three more and to do

66
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,770
that I'm just doing shift alter shift option and down.

67
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:15,150
OK so let's let's do settings and let's do a search on

68
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,800
and stars icon.

69
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,010
OK.

70
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,260
So if we save that we get a bunch of different icons and if we want to change the color that's simple

71
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,990
we just add text colors so red dash text.

72
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,730
Technically these are fonts.

73
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,830
So we want to add you want to use the text colors will say blue dash text and save.

74
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,070
And I can see that those two icons have different colors.

75
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,470
We can also change the sizes.

76
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:58,560
So what I'll do is let's say I class material icons just using Emett here and then let's just take the

77
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:06,290
done icon which is basically a checkmark can see right here and I'm going to just copy this down four

78
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:14,540
times and this one here I'm also going to give a class of large and for this one I'll give a class of

79
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,220
medium.

80
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,750
This one will be small and this one will be tiny.

81
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:29,410
OK so let's save that and you can see we can have different sizes of icons using these different classes.

82
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:37,060
Now what if we want to have a button with icons so for that we go down here to button with material

83
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,320
icon and let's add inside the tag.

84
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,280
And this could be just as well a button but we're using an Atallah here.

85
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,040
Let's give it a beat and.

86
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:57,000
And we'll even give it a waves effect and say Wavves dash light.

87
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:09,070
And inside here next to the by now text we're going to put in I tag give it a class of material dash.

88
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,020
And inside here let's use the shopping cart icon

89
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:26,600
I will just put a little space here and let's save and I can see we have a button with an icon now to

90
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:35,570
make this a little more aligned to what we can do is we can add in the class with material icons left

91
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,530
and save.

92
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:43,010
And now you see it's aligned nicely and we can do the same thing with a right aligned icon.

93
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:51,470
So if I were to copy this I will just replace this one and we'll go ahead and just change it to right

94
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,700
right here and save.

95
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,140
Now the icon is on the right.

96
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,000
And then just to show you we can use font awesome icons.

97
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:09,500
I'll copy this a tag and instead of doing it like this we'll use the font awesome method which doesn't

98
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,700
have anything inside the eye element we just need to add a special class of F.A. for font.

99
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,610
Awesome.

100
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,050
And then whatever icon we want which we want.

101
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,350
F.A. dash shopping dash cart.

102
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,170
And then we'll put it on the left and we'll save.

103
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,600
And there we go you can see it looks slightly different because this is a fine awesome icon.

104
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,230
All right.

105
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,110
And you can go to I think it's fine.

106
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,170
Awesome dog.

107
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,030
I know.

108
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,250
And you can see all the different icons they have.

109
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:50,000
All right so we can have different colored buttons so if we just go ahead and add a class of BGN and

110
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,780
we could add for instance red and save we get a red button.

111
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,470
We could do better then let's do purple.

112
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,980
You're not limited to any colors you can use any of the colors that are available

113
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,950
so if we wanted to do like Tio do that

114
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,990
if we wanted to do black

115
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:37,650
or eyelets to Amber and save and we get all these nice looking colored buttons.

116
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,140
Okay and last two things I want to show you are large Broughton's and disabled buttons.

117
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:51,280
So our class of DTN And actually we don't even need the just the beat and we can just do between large

118
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,950
and save and we get a large button.

119
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,640
Now for some frameworks like bootstrap you'd have to do both the beat and.

120
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,340
And then I think it's between algae or something like that.

121
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,480
But it materialized we just need the one BT and large.

122
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:14,410
Now for a button to be disabled well just give it a BGN in class will make this one large as well should

123
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,700
be in the class.

124
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,790
So just to be Teahen large.

125
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:25,390
And then we'll add a class of disabled and save.

126
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,320
And now that button is disabled so I can't click on it or anything.

127
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,790
All right so that's going to be guys in the next video we're still going to look at Buttons what we're

128
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,890
going to look at the floating buttons which are one of the coolest elements in materialise.
