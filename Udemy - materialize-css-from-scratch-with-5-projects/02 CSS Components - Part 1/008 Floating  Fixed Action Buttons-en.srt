1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:00,960
All right.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,870
So in the last video we looked at just standard buttons.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,760
Now we're going to look at floating buttons and fixed action buttons.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:14,730
And if you've ever seen anything with materialize you've probably seen these before the circular buttons.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,820
We can even have them fixed to the bottom here or wherever and we can have it make it so that we click

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,030
and then some other buttons open and it looks really cool it's just a really cool looking UI.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,340
So let's start with a simple floating button so I'm in my two four floating dot age team I'll file I

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:40,920
have it open in my browser and we just basically have a button here with an I tag OK no classes or anything

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,280
yet.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,750
We're going to add that now.

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:54,210
So for the button we're going to add a class of between dash floating and if we save that it's going

12
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,910
to just be a saw basically a circle and then we want to add let's make it a large button so add beats

13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,420
and dash large.

14
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,140
So that makes it bigger.

15
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,530
Let's also give it the waves of fact.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,520
So we'll see waves effect.

17
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:18,040
And we also do waves dash lights and then let's also change the color to red.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,410
So save Now these buttons normally have icons inside of them or else it's just a circle.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:32,520
So what we'll do is give this the standard class of material dash icons and then the icon I want is

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,820
a plus sign which is the ad icon so let's save that and there we go.

21
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:43,070
So there we have a floating button and you can see it has that Wavves effect.

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,990
So what I'll do is copy this and let's create another one.

23
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:53,970
So just paste that here actually will make this one a link so I'll just make this in a tag instead of

24
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,810
a button.

25
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,300
Go and put a tag there as well.

26
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,810
Let's change the icon to it.

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,540
And let's also change the color to blue and save.

28
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,810
And there we go.

29
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,790
Now we can also add a pulse effect and this isn't just for floating buttons.

30
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,740
This is an effect you can put on.

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,140
Pretty pretty sure you can put it on anything but it looks really good on button.

32
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,720
So what I'm going to do is just grab this whole a tag the folding button here actually will grab this

33
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:34,740
standard button tag and paste that in and I'm going to change the icon to publish just to make it a

34
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,460
little different.

35
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:42,790
And then I'm also going to change the color to green and then I'm simply going to add the class of pulse.

36
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,320
OK and we'll save that.

37
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,900
And now you can see that it just has a constant pulse effect which looks pretty cool.

38
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,160
So these are standard floating buttons.

39
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,910
Now I'm going to comment out everything we just did in vs code you can just do contard you can highlight

40
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,590
it and you can do control and then forward slash and I will comment everything out.

41
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:13,710
See why is this I guess since we have a comment here we have to do it separately so we'll comment the

42
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,970
stuff and then we'll comment.

43
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,730
So OK so now let's down to the simple fixed action button.

44
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,350
And basically what this does is it'll give us the folding button.

45
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:33,410
But it will be down here and it will be in place we won't be able to move it no matter how big you resize

46
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,750
the browser or make it smaller.

47
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,020
It should stay in that place.

48
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:48,320
All right so let's go ahead and just add to this div here a class of fixed will see fixed dash action

49
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:58,720
dash button and then we're going to go into the button the actual button and say between dash.

50
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,070
Floating.

51
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:09,070
Let's also do BT and dash large and let's make it red and then I'm also going to give this an add icon

52
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:21,620
and we'll save let's see what am I missing here I forgot the class.

53
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:33,500
So should the class equals and save should be material icons.

54
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,400
So we have the button now it's not fixed.

55
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:45,270
That's because it shouldn't be button the word it should be between so fixed action between then and

56
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,310
now you can see that it's in place down here.

57
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:56,060
And even if I were to make this smaller it's just going to stay there it's absolute basically OK.

58
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,170
So now what I want to do is make it so that we can have a button here and if we click it will have a

59
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,900
bunch of other buttons kind of just pop up right here which looks really nice.

60
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:14,430
So I'm going to comment this so that we just did and go down here and we're going to add in a bunch

61
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,650
of stuff here.

62
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:25,640
So we're going to put in this div a class of fixed dash action dash B.T. and not button.

63
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:41,820
I want to do BT and then this tag will do Class B and ash floating and we'll make it large and red and

64
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,050
then for the icon

65
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,550
the icon let's do mode dash at it.

66
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,560
So this would be like something you'd have on on a blog added page something like that a post and a

67
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,450
page.

68
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,270
And then in the UL This is where the pop up buttons are going to go.

69
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:14,270
So we actually want to go into the ally and into the tag and we're going to add a class of again between

70
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,240
Dasch floating and we'll make this read.

71
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:30,780
And for the icon to insert char OK and of course we need the class

72
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,510
material icons.

73
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:42,100
All right so will do that's when you will go to the next one here.

74
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,710
Let's actually just copy this.

75
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:51,240
Ally and then we'll just pasted in what's this one two three more times

76
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,080
you know change this one to say blue will change the icon

77
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,380
will change just to its two format quote

78
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:16,660
and then this one will be yellow and will change that icon to publish.

79
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:30,700
And then this final one here say green and we'll change that to attach file attach underscore file.

80
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:37,240
All right so if I go down here and now you see when I hover over it it gives us these other floating

81
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,100
buttons which looks really nice.

82
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,200
Now there's a couple options that we can add to this you'll see in the comment.

83
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:53,350
I have horizontal and click to toggle those are two actions or two classes that we can add to change

84
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:57,430
the effect so you see how it comes from the top end goes up.

85
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:06,760
We can make this go this way horizontal by going ahead and adding in a horizontal class like that.

86
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,910
So if we save and I go on I hover.

87
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,910
Now it goes the other way.

88
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,150
Now if you want to make it so that you have to actually click it click it for this effect then you can

89
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:22,500
do that as well by adding in click dash to dash toggle.

90
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,600
So now if I go down I hover it doesn't do anything.

91
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,010
If I click it that it does I can just toggle that effect.

92
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,550
All right.

93
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,270
Now one other thing I'm going to show you is the fixed action button toolbar which is another really

94
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:46,780
cool effect but after a comment this stuff out or else we'll have some some compatibility issues and

95
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,580
we're going to go ahead and add on to this div..

96
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,040
We're going to give it a class of fixed action button and then also we're going to give you a class

97
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,820
of toolbar.

98
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,430
OK.

99
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:11,580
Now for this inside the div this link here is a tag we're going to give this a class of beat dash floating.

100
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:18,310
And then let's make it large and let's make it red and then for the icon

101
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,590
we're going to do the mode and it

102
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,950
OK and then the well doesn't need anything else.

103
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:45,000
However we're going to give a class of waves waves effect and waves dash light.

104
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,580
OK and the ATAC does not have a class on it or anything like that.

105
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,630
But let's put our icons so this will be insert charts

106
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,230
all right.

107
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:10,890
And what I'll do is just grab this ally here with the class and just pass that on to these beginning

108
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:17,280
allies and then let's also copy the icon just to make this shorter.

109
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,030
And we'll change these icons so this one will be format quote

110
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,180
and let's do publish

111
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:40,300
and let's to attach file.

112
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,110
OK so let's save.

113
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:50,170
And now if I go down and they click on this button there economy it turns into a toolbar which is pretty

114
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:50,940
cool.

115
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,800
And if I click off of the toolbar it goes back to the button.

116
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,980
So this is the kind of stuff that I think separates materialize from Bootstrap bootstrap does not have

117
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,560
stuff like this.

118
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,230
OK.

119
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,580
Interactive UI elements like this.

120
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,050
I'm not saying one is better than the other.

121
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:17,630
Bootstrap is much more used so it is very beneficial to learn bootstrap.

122
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:24,140
But as far as design elements go I'm a fan of materialize.

123
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:31,240
Now we can open and close this stuff through javascript as well so if I were to go down here and let's

124
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:44,560
use a little bit of jay query and we'll say fixed action dash between and let's call open toolbar

125
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,400
OK so we're grabbing the fixed action button which is this and we're calling a function called Open

126
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,570
toolbar and that's going to run when the page loads so it's save.

127
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:05,770
And you'll see that it just automatically goes to a toolbar and at the same time we have a closed toolbar.

128
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:14,840
So if we say close to our IT basically just opens and closes when the when we enter the page.

129
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:21,190
OK so you can you can manipulate it from the javascript and you can do the same thing with the standard

130
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:27,410
floating action buttons by doing instead of open toolbar.

131
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:34,020
You could do open fab like that and you can do close fab.

132
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,860
OK.

133
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:41,550
So that would be for the floating button that we have commented out or I'm sorry the fixed action button

134
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,510
the fab.

135
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,710
So you can open and close out from javascript as well but I'm just going to comment this stuff out.

136
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,670
I just wanted in there so you guys know that that's possible.

137
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:51,990
All right.

138
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,070
So that's it.

139
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,270
That's it for floating buttons.

140
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,940
We will get back into these later on.

141
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,880
But in the next video we're going to start to look at nav bars navigation in material eyes.
