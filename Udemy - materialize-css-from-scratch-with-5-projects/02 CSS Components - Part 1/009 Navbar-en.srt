1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,580
All right guys so now we're going to get into the nav bar of.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,990
Now one thing you may notice that's different about this file is where it says start here it's actually

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,200
under the container and the reason I did that is because most nav bars are going to go all the way across

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,650
the page you're not going to be restricted inside of the container.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,750
So that's what I wanted to do so I put every all the bars underneath the containers so they go all the

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,980
way across.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:33,090
So first we're going to look at just the standard navigation menu so just having the nav tag gives us

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,670
all of this so it gives us this pinkish background and padding and all that.

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:47,200
In fact if we look at the see SS by hover over the nav and we go down you see and automatically has

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,060
a height of 64 pixels that has this background color here with 100 percent color of white.

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,190
So just the nav tag has quite a bit of style with materialize.

12
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:06,400
Now to turn it into an actual nav bar what we'll do is go to this first div right here and we're going

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,100
to add a class of NAV dash wrapper.

14
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,880
All right.

15
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:17,020
And then we're going to go to the next div and what I like to do is put a container class inside of

16
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,530
the Nav wrapper and you don't have to do this.

17
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:25,540
But if you don't your nav bar is going to it's going to be stuck up against the side like this how this

18
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,560
logo is and it's going to stretch no matter how far you go.

19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,830
So I like to put a container within it.

20
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,890
So if I save that now you can see that that's pushed in.

21
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,880
All right.

22
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:47,970
So it's the for the logo the tag that has the logo in it we're going to give that a class and that's

23
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:54,210
going to be brand brand dash logo.

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,980
OK so once they do that notice that you can see our links.

25
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,530
OK now these will change based on

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,030
while actually that's actually I guess it's not going to change based on the screen size just yet.

27
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:20,860
But what we can do is we can add to our UL which is going to have an ID of NAV dash mobile and then

28
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,800
we can add a class here and we're going to say.

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,980
Right.

30
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,090
And that will move all of our links to the right.

31
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:38,440
And then let's do hide on small and down.

32
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,500
Now what this means is that these links are going to be hidden.

33
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,480
If the size of the browser of the device is on the small size or lower.

34
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:55,690
So if I go ahead and save this it's not quite on small yet but if I make the smaller use you'll notice

35
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:01,270
that they disappear OK and that so it doesn't run into the logo.

36
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,260
By default the logo is going to be centered when it's on a smaller screen.

37
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,190
When I go back up you'll see that it gets it's now on the left.

38
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,010
OK.

39
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,640
So when I get around tablet size or maybe a little bigger I maybe like laptop size the logo automatically

40
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,930
goes to the middle and then we get really small the menu items disappear OK.

41
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:32,640
So our solution to this for mobile devices would be to add a button that we could click that would open

42
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,300
up a side menu with the links.

43
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:43,030
OK so that's what we're going to do next we're going to go down to our responsive side menu or a response

44
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,720
I should say responsive nav bar with side menu.

45
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,310
So let's go ahead and add I'm actually going to change the color as well.

46
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,850
You can change the color of absolutely anything.

47
00:03:53,850 --> 00:04:00,070
So the nav bar will say we want it to be blue and let's add Darkon dash 4.

48
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,320
OK and that gives us a blue nav bar also going to give it a container

49
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,130
and let's add to this div right here we want.

50
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,210
Now rapper

51
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:28,850
and for the logo let's add class brand dash logo.

52
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,690
OK so that moves it to the middle.

53
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:40,780
And you see this a tag here is going to is basically going to be like our hamburger menu it's going

54
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,280
to be the icon we click that opens up the sidebar.

55
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,580
So we need to add a couple of things to this one as a class.

56
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:59,100
So we're going to say class equals and we're going to set this to the button dash collapse class.

57
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:05,130
Now in addition to a class we need an attribute called Data dash activates.

58
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,770
OK because we're activating the mobile menu.

59
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:16,120
So I'm going to call this mobile dash now and you can call this whatever you want you just have to make

60
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,470
sure that your UL that you put down here has that ID.

61
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,150
All right but before we get to that let's first add the icon we want.

62
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,110
So this will be class material icons.

63
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:35,410
Ok it's always material icons no matter what the icon you want goes in here which in this case will

64
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,930
be menu.

65
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,070
All right so that looks a little weird.

66
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,320
We have the the icon but all of the drop all of the links are showing.

67
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:53,100
So to fix that we want to go to this well here and we want to add our class.

68
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,020
First we want to say right and then we want to say hide on.

69
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:07,640
And this time I'm going to do medium screens on medium screens and down and save and now that right

70
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,460
menu is hidden.

71
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,190
OK.

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,700
Now this.

73
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,000
See we're going to ignore the dropdown right now.

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,150
That's actually part of the well that's hidden what you're seeing here the home about them contact is

75
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:25,740
this.

76
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,890
Well now this is what's going to open on the sidebar when we click this button.

77
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,320
OK.

78
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,430
But we don't want it to show here.

79
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:44,180
So what we do is add a class of side dash nav and then we want to give it an I.D. that matches whatever.

80
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,650
This is the data activates in this case it's mobile nav.

81
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,790
So we want to go down here and we want to make sure that that ID is mobile nav.

82
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,010
Now if I save you'll see it disappears.

83
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,150
OK which is what we want.

84
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,320
Now if I click on the button here nothing happens.

85
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,630
That's because in order to use the side NAV you need to actually initialize it in Jey query in javascript

86
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,570
so we're going to go way down to the bottom and we're going to initialize this sidebar by using Jay

87
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,400
queery and sing dot button collapse.

88
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:27,820
OK button collapse is the class of this button right here and then we're going to just say Daut side

89
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,520
now.

90
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,520
OK we're going to call that function.

91
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,570
And now if I save and I go in I click.

92
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:40,300
There we go it opens up a sidebar with whatever is in this UL right here.

93
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,080
OK.

94
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:47,280
So you could have a different set of links here.

95
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,620
Ignore this thing.

96
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,340
Ignore this stuff for now.

97
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,810
But you can have a different set of links here in fact we do.

98
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,990
Then your sidebar or you could have them the exact same so it just works like a responsive menu.

99
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,680
OK hopefully that makes sense.

100
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,290
So now what I'm going to do is just make sure that this all these links are showing.

101
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:12,300
And we're going to now work on it say will do.

102
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,370
Let's do the dropdown.

103
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,850
OK so we have a list item here under the home about contact.

104
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,480
Then we have this list item and I want this to be a dropdown.

105
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:37,900
And what we need to do is let's say we need to added Id or ID we just need to actually you seek at a

106
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,890
class

107
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,560
in the class of dropdown button.

108
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,400
Dash button.

109
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,790
All right.

110
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,660
And then let's just put in.

111
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,230
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:53,230 --> 00:09:02,980
This should be on the tag not the ally.

113
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,550
All right.

114
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,030
So draw down button.

115
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,250
And then it's going to also have a data activates

116
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,420
and we want to set this to.

117
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,770
We could set this to anything I'm going to set it to my dash dropped down

118
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,340
and let's see we're going to have an icon in here.

119
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:35,430
So this icon is going to be like in a down arrow that you would have next door dropped down so it's

120
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:42,180
going to be erro dash drop dash down.

121
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,530
So we'll save that

122
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,400
and see.

123
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,340
That's weird.

124
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,700
Oh you know we need to put a right class with the material icons.

125
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,410
There we go.

126
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,310
So now we have the arrow there.

127
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:06,690
Now it's not going to work what it's doing is it's looking for an idea of my dropdown and it's looking

128
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:13,950
for a UL with that I.D. Now that you well we can put anywhere we can put it here or we could just go

129
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,890
outside of the nav bar itself and put it down which I actually have it right here.

130
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:30,450
So I'm just going to give this an idea now of my dash dropdown cage match whatever that data activates

131
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:37,110
was and then it also has a class of dropdown dash content.

132
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,500
OK and that's it.

133
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,840
Let's save and let's go over here and now when I hover over it.

134
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,230
There we go.

135
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,680
You can see this UL is showing.

136
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,730
So this you can be completely separate from the nav bar we can put this at the bottom of the file it

137
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:58,700
doesn't matter as long as this ID my dropdown matches whatever we put in the data activates.

138
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,330
OK so just a couple of other things I want to mention a button link.

139
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,350
So this log in let's say we want that to be a button.

140
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:14,170
All we would have to do is go and add to our tag here.

141
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:25,980
Class equals BTA and we could give it a wave's effect say Wavves dash lights and save.

142
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,550
And there we go.

143
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:31,550
Now we have a button in our NAV are OK we can also have an icon link.

144
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,810
This P actually wasn't supposed to be here.

145
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,540
That's right.

146
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,550
It's just part of.

147
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:47,210
Person which is the icon I want to use say class material icons and save.

148
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,930
And there we go.

149
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,990
Now we have a little icon inside the nav bar.

150
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,020
So couple other things if we wanted to make a link active.

151
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,530
I'm just going to make this a little smaller.

152
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,960
Let's say we want this about linked to be active.

153
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:12,330
I'm going to go up to the top menu here and just add onto the ally tag the class of active and save.

154
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,410
And I can see that's active.

155
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,650
Now when we make this bigger the logo automatically goes to the left.

156
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:27,580
But if we wanted that to stay in the center we could also add to the brand logo class a center class

157
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,620
and save.

158
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,410
And now you see it will stay in the center no matter what.

159
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,720
So just a couple extra things that you can do with your nav bars.

160
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,090
So what about the fixed nav bar meaning that if we scroll down we want it to basically just stay in

161
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:43,650
place.

162
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:49,540
So what I'm going to do is take the standard menu that we have and we'll just grab that whole thing

163
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,350
and go down to where it says fixed nav bar and just replace these two.

164
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,090
Actually I'm going to put it inside the device sorry.

165
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:05,290
And all we have to do to make it fixed is take this device wrap it around the nav bar and give it a

166
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:12,940
class of nav bar dash fixed and save will actually make this a different color.

167
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:22,570
We'll make this one black and save and it's fixed so you can see I can scroll actually to make this

168
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,300
a little more understandable.

169
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,650
Let's make this margin top 1000.

170
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,470
And now if I scroll you'll see it's just going to stay in place and usually you'd have this at the top

171
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,380
so it would stay right at the top.

172
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,300
All right so the last thing I want to show you is a search bar which is kind of like just a nav bar

173
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,130
search box kind of thing.

174
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:53,920
So I'm just going to type this out quickly will have a nav with the class of let's make it green and

175
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,390
let's put in a class of Nav. wrapper and then we'll put in a form.

176
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,960
We don't need an action.

177
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,370
It's not going to actually do anything it's just a form.

178
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,160
We're going to have a class of input field and we're going to get into this later on when we get to

179
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,230
forms and we'll have an input.

180
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:26,820
We'll give an idea of search and let's give it a type of search and we'll just say it's required

181
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:39,740
acquired and then we're going to put in a label and I'm going to give this a class of labeled dash icon

182
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:48,080
and we'll say for search and let's see inside the label.

183
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:59,120
I'm actually going to put in I tag put our material icons class and let's make this a search icon and

184
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:10,130
then I also want a close icon after the labels will say material icons and clothes.

185
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:10,420
All right.

186
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:17,570
Let's save that now a little search icon if I click it and it becomes a search box if I could close

187
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,560
it goes back.

188
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,710
So pretty cool.

189
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,450
All right so that's going to be it for now.

190
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:29,120
Barrs guys in the next video we're going to start to look at collections which are kind of like fancy

191
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,350
lists groups or fancy list items.
