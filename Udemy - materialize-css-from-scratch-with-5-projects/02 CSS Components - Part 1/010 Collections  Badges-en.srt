1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,950
All right in this video we're going to take a look at collections which are a big part of materialize

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,900
a lot of times you're going to have lists of data especially if you're building like an application

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,760
that fetches from an API you might want to display that data that comes back inside of a collection.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,140
So we have some markup here it just looks horrible by default without any of the classes or anything.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,340
So we're going to work on this we're going to start with the just standard collection.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,240
OK we're in the 2 6 collections age Tim I'll file and to create a collection.

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,310
All we have to do is add a class of collection.

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,750
And these are similar to lists groups in Bootstrap where you'd have a class of lists group and then

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:47,250
you'd have a class of lists group item well in materialise we just want a class of collection item.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,430
OK so pretty much the same kind of thing.

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,900
A collection item.

12
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,290
All right.

13
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,150
And let's save that.

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,330
And there we go so that looks a lot better than it did before.

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,080
And that's just a basic collection item.

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,710
Now you may want to have a collection item as a link.

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,650
So kind of like a menu maybe a side menu.

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:40,340
In this case we'd have a div and we'd give it a class of collection and then for each tag here we'd

19
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,030
have a class of collection item.

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,770
OK so basically the same classes just different elements.

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,310
And I'll just copy this make this a little quicker.

22
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,760
OK.

23
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,620
And let's see the badges.

24
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,380
I'm just going get rid of that for now.

25
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,710
We'll do that after.

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,690
So let's save.

27
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,310
And now you can see we have kind of like a side menu we have a collection links.

28
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:11,690
All right.

29
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:21,020
Now badges are just like little if you want a little box with maybe these are our categories of blog

30
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,260
posts and you might want to have the number of posts in each category.

31
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:37,460
That's where a badge comes in handy so we'd have a span and then we would do class equals badge and

32
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,350
actually you know class equals badge.

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,100
And then let's save that see what that looks like.

34
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,970
Second 44

35
00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:01,120
Oh we get to give this class of collection item.

36
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,090
OK.

37
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,510
So it's just basically just putting a number over here.

38
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,230
Now we want to make it look a little bit fancier.

39
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,030
What we could do.

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,080
We need our classic election for this a tag.

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:20,720
And then in this span let's do class badge and also do new and save.

42
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:27,040
And what that does is it basically gives it a background here.

43
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:34,350
And it also puts in new and it's helpful because you wouldn't have to put in the word new programmatically

44
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:40,940
you could just have just the number and then materialized takes care of putting in the word new.

45
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,200
All right so let's take a look at a whole collection with a header.

46
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:53,540
So what we would do is have a UL and give it a class of collection just like above.

47
00:03:53,670 --> 00:04:01,510
But we would also have a class of with Dasch not with w i th with header.

48
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,190
OK.

49
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:12,050
And then for this first ally it would have a class of collection dash Hetter.

50
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,440
All right.

51
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:19,270
In the rest of these will have classes of collection item just like any other collection.

52
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,850
All right so let's go ahead and save that.

53
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:34,410
And now if we look down here we have this header that says items and then we have all the items underneath.

54
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,340
OK so we also have something called secondary content

55
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,870
and looks like I have an extra or I forgot my angle bracket right here.

56
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,320
OK.

57
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,120
For secondary content the UL.

58
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:57,020
We're going to do again collection and then with Hetter need a class though.

59
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:17,570
And then this list item will have a class of collection header and say items and then each of these

60
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,930
allies will have a collection item class.

61
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:27,640
And now under the first item here or under whatever text is here we have an eight tag and we're going

62
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:34,460
to give this a tag class of secondary content.

63
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,180
OK.

64
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,100
And then the secondary content is going to be an icon.

65
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,530
I'm going to make it a close eye on making an X so let's say it was something you could delete

66
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,880
it all right.

67
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,790
So if I save that now you see we have a collection item with an X over here and just to shorten this

68
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:09,110
up let's take this ally and let's see we have three more so we'll go one two three and I'll just change

69
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,200
this to second third.

70
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,590
And fourth they're all going to have the same X icons so that's fine.

71
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:27,110
All right so now we just have a collection with some delete icons over here.

72
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:36,660
Now we can also do Avatar content or Avatar collections where we can have like either an icon on the

73
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,080
side or an out an image we could form an image we're just going to use icons.

74
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,180
We're going to pretend this is like an address book type thing.

75
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:54,890
So we'll go ahead and give this you all a class of collection and this ally will be abse

76
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,690
class collection and or a collection item.

77
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,260
And then also avatar.

78
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,510
All right and I'm just going to copy that.

79
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,970
OK and then the icon underneath.

80
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,690
Let's make this a Contax icon.

81
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:26,260
And we're going to give this a couple classes in addition to material icons because I want it to be

82
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,950
blue.

83
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:34,320
And I also wanted to be a circle k so we can give this a circle class and then we're going to leave.

84
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:41,970
Actually the span we're going to give it a class of title which I think just makes it a little bigger

85
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,070
or a little more prominent and then that stuff will stay.

86
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,860
No need for for any classes on that.

87
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,520
That's a tag this will be the secondary content

88
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:06,620
that should be secondary Dasch content and let's make this a great icon.

89
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,530
Or if I save that.

90
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,510
There we go so that looks pretty good.

91
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,110
You know what I'm going to do instead of having to type all that out let's just copy the whole ally

92
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,680
and we'll just replace these three other guys so I'll paste that in.

93
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:37,930
That's one two three and then we'll just change the names.

94
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:48,520
So say Steve Smith.

95
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,160
Hey Karen

96
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:06,320
and I will say Mary Williams and Mary and we'll just leave the same phone number.

97
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,220
Not a big deal just want to show you how it's formatted so that looks pretty good.

98
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:11,950
All right.

99
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:19,650
So one other thing I wanted to show you that isn't really relevant to collection's is having a badge

100
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,280
inside of a dropdown OK because we also mentioned badges and this in this lecture.

101
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,240
So we're just going to have basically a button that has a drop down and we can put a badge inside of

102
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,590
it so let's do a tag with the class of B.T. And and we're also going to give it a class of dropdown

103
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,560
dash button.

104
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,120
OK.

105
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,910
And then we're going to give it a data activates

106
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,160
because the sidebar

107
00:09:52,620 --> 00:10:03,030
So our data activates I'm going to set this to drop down one and inside here let's just say drop down

108
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,810
and let's put an icon.

109
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,760
I'm going to go on the next line.

110
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:23,570
And this will be an arrow underscore this drop underscored down so if I saved that.

111
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:34,570
Now we have this drop down in let's see for the HGF I'm just going to do a hash in a exclamation so

112
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,270
it doesn't go anywhere.

113
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:43,840
Now underneath that let's create our UL with the ID of draw down 1 K because that's what we use for

114
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,120
the data activates.

115
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,080
So inside here.

116
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:53,850
And this actually also has to have a class of dropdown content.

117
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,340
OK.

118
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,320
So I will put in an ally.

119
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:10,200
And inside the ally will have an eight tag and let's say this is item 1.

120
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,200
Shall just go ahead and make a couple of these

121
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,150
proofs.

122
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,070
Sorry about that

123
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:36,680
all right so the Subi for three and two for save that.

124
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:44,610
Now we have our drop down now if we wanted to put a badge in one of these we could go inside the tag

125
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:52,190
and we could say spanne class badge and I'll say 44.

126
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,080
All right we could also do a new badge

127
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:02,570
so we could say spand class badge and new.

128
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,270
And we'll say three.

129
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,960
All right so let's save and there we go.

130
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:15,950
So if you had like a directory site or something like that you add new new items or new posts you could

131
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,140
use these badges.

132
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,240
All right so that's going to be IT guys that is collections and badges in the next video we're going

133
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,510
to.

134
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:29,690
We're going to work on a really important part of materialized or any framework and that is the grid

135
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,240
system.
