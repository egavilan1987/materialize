1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,690
All right so now we're going to take a look at one of the most important parts of any framework and

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,190
that's the grid system.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,510
So the materialized grid is pretty easy to use.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,570
One thing I want to do before we get started is go into the head you see the style tags.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,700
We're just going to add the style for a collage class of box because I want to make the grid I want

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,590
you to be able to see the columns better.

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:30,600
So we're going to have a class box with a background of light gray which is F for three times and then

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,540
we're going to have just some padding.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:39,320
So we'll say 10 pixels padding and then we're going to just text a line to the center.

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:49,350
OK so save that and we'll go down to where it says Start here and we're going to first look at non-responsive

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,960
grids meaning that whatever columns we put it's going to be the same for all screen sizes.

12
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:56,300
OK.

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:03,020
Now all grids should be wrapped in the class of row just like bootstrap if you're familiar with bootstrap.

14
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,550
And then what I want is 12 one column divs So we're going to have the class of call.

15
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,150
We're also going to have the class of S1.

16
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:11,810
OK.

17
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:23,330
Now as for small we basically have four sizes we have small we have medium large and extra large.

18
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,200
OK.

19
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,530
Now if we just too small it basically propagates up.

20
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,430
So any.

21
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:36,810
If we say small one it's also going to be medium one large one extra large one it's going to be just

22
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,040
a non-responsive grade it's going to always be the same.

23
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,450
So in here I'm going to put our box class in I'm just going to put the number one Actually I'll leave

24
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,560
that blank and then I'm just going to copy this down.

25
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:58,770
So let's do 12 of these so two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 and save and you can see

26
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:18,890
that we have 12 columns I'm just going to put numbers in here so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 11 and 12.

27
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:19,530
All right.

28
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:26,900
So there our 12 column div and no matter what screen size I have it on it's always going to be 12 columns.

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,190
OK so let's do one example for let's say three four column divs.

30
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:41,710
So we'd have our row and then we would do call and we'd say ask for a member of this 12 all together.

31
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,750
So four times three is 12.

32
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,870
So if we want three of them three full columns and we want it to be an ask for an inside here we'll

33
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:58,870
do dot box and we'll say 1 and then what I'll do is just grab this and let's make two more of these

34
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:07,810
and we'll just change this to three and we'll change this to two and save.

35
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,290
And then we go Oh so now we have three four column divs.

36
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,620
So let's say we want to do two six column divs if you guys want to pause it and try and come back.

37
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,070
You can do that but it's really easy.

38
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,900
We're just going to do call and let's do x 6.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,370
Ok so I have 2 6 column divs let's say box and one will do the same thing here so call six.

40
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,510
And inside here will two box and two.

41
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,480
And there we go.

42
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,630
Now we have two six column dips.

43
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,220
OK and if we wanted to do an 8 and 4 so like a side bar in the main area that's really easy we'll just

44
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:03,310
do a row and then we'll do a class of call and lets 2 8 8 be call

45
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,670
and we'll do what we call it.

46
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,530
Box

47
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,640
is called dots and this one will be s for

48
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,720
and then we go.

49
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,700
So now we have eight and four.

50
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,030
All right.

51
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,340
So as I said these these will stay the same no matter what the screen size.

52
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:39,130
Now if you wanted to make a responsive grade have inhabit different for multiple sizes for instance

53
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,310
let's take it

54
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:57,740
let's take our first example which is 12 one column does so I'll just grab that actually know what I'll

55
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,710
do.

56
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:10,890
Let's let's grab all of these so we'll grab the 12 one columns the three four columns and the two six

57
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:16,200
columns and we'll grab all of them and paste them in here.

58
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,470
But I'm going to get rid of these and the rid of the comments because they're going to change based

59
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,720
on size screen size.

60
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:36,340
So for this usually what we would do is we keep the or we change this to one if we wanted a 12 column.

61
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:45,960
So it's a medium size screens and up will be it'll be a 12 column row so no change at all to M1.

62
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:54,410
But if we get to small screens obviously I mean that's just it's too squished in there so let's change

63
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:00,110
it to x 12 where the column takes up the entire thing.

64
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:11,840
OK so it will be stacked so we'll just go ahead and add in as 12 like that.

65
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:19,630
I don't think I've ever even used a 12 column div but just to show you can know if I go when I make

66
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,160
this smaller.

67
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,890
When we get to small screens eight stacks.

68
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:29,280
OK so it makes it responsive if I get to here.

69
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,500
Now it's back to 12.

70
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:39,410
All right so let's go ahead and do this one here and we'll say instead of S-4 will say M four for a

71
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:48,270
medium and then we'll say x 12 which will make it stack because the small screens will take up all 12.

72
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,580
All right so if I go ahead and make the smaller.

73
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,720
Now I can see that this is now stacking on small screens.

74
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,800
OK so that makes that responsive.

75
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:06,090
Let's see four Actually we don't need to do this one is pretty much the same thing but for this one

76
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,240
here I'm going to add a bunch of different sizes.

77
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,970
So we'll have s 12 if it's a small screen.

78
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,960
Now if it's a medium screen let's do six and six.

79
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,040
So I've 2 six column divs.

80
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:29,910
If it's a large screen then let's do let's save the large screen we'll do nine

81
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,980
yeah we'll do.

82
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,070
Actually no it's 2 8 and 4.

83
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,280
OK.

84
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,780
And then if it's an extra large so say extra large and we'll do nine and we'll do three.

85
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,820
OK so this is a very responsive grid so let's save We'll start at the small screen.

86
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,260
So we're looking at the bottom one here you can see it stacked on small screens.

87
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:03,640
We get to see the medium screen and now it's six and six.

88
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,580
OK so it's two six columns.

89
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:15,550
If we get two large screens which is still not there right here now it's nine and 3.

90
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,930
And then if we get to extra large which is what make it really big now it's 8 and 4.

91
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:23,840
OK.

92
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,980
I'm sorry it's the opposite.

93
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:31,360
It was 8 and 4 with large and it's 9 and 3 with extra large OK.

94
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,890
So this is a very that's a very responsive grid row.

95
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:44,250
So another thing we can do is we can use push and poll to kind of switch the positions of the columns.

96
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:53,060
So we give you an example I'll put in a row and I'm going to put a class of call let's do s will say

97
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,940
s 7 which will just be 7 for all all sizes.

98
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:08,090
And then actually we'll just do that for now and then we'll say Daut box and 1 and then for this one

99
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:16,510
we'll do call S-5 and we'll save box 2 and save.

100
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,640
So we're looking at this bottom one here.

101
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:23,600
Now if I wanted to just switch these but not change the markup around what I could do is just add a

102
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,970
class of push and then say I want S-5 on this one.

103
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:36,930
And then this will save push and we'll do seven and save.

104
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:37,680
I'm sorry.

105
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,980
Paul has seven.

106
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,950
So he should have Push and Pull.

107
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,460
And now they're reversed.

108
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:51,730
So now to actually has is on this side and the one is on this side.

109
00:09:52,200 --> 00:10:00,990
So this one gets pushed into the S-5 this one gets pushed into the seven all I should say pulled into

110
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,230
the seven.

111
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,450
OK another thing that will we'll deal with is offsets.

112
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,450
So if you don't want to take up all 12 like let's say you only want a six column div but you want to

113
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,110
move it into the middle and this is used often for like log and page.

114
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:25,290
So what we would do is create a row and we would create our column and let's say six.

115
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:32,070
And then what we'll do is we'll say offset and let's say offset 3.

116
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,050
OK.

117
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:41,550
And here we'll just put our box and we'll just we'll say log in and save and then we go.

118
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,110
So what happens is we have a six column div.

119
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,620
But we pushed it over or we offset it by three columns.

120
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,010
All right.

121
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,470
If I offset it by four then it's going to get pushed over a little more.

122
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,300
OK if I offset it by six it's going to go all the way to the other side.

123
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:58,880
OK.

124
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:04,620
But a lot of times if you're doing a log and you'll do like you'll make it right in the middle.

125
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:04,980
All right.

126
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,320
So I think that's going to be the guys we're going to be using the grid system a lot not just in the

127
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,320
projects but even in later sandbox lectures.

128
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:20,610
So this is something that we're going to kind of drill into your head as we go through the course.

129
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,430
All right thanks for watching and I will see.
