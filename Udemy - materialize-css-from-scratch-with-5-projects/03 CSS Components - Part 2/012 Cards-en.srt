1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,440
All right guys so we're going to start to get into cards which are a big part of a lot of frameworks

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,830
slightly bootstrapped for added cards instead of the old panels that they used to use they're just a

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,720
nice way of displaying content.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,760
They give you a border or a drop shadow.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,150
You can use images in them links buttons and it just makes things look really nice.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,480
So what we're going to do here is just start with a simple card without a title.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,180
So this is the three underscore one cards dot each time l file.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,250
So basically we just have two divs.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,540
Now before I go into this notice that I have a row here and we're using the grid system.

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,570
Basically we have two 6 column divs.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,570
All right.

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,490
That's how we're going to display these cards so we have our other six column div.

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,820
Then we have another row with two six column div.

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,990
So it's like that the whole way down.

15
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,400
All right.

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,630
So you can kind of ignore this stuff it's just mapping out our grid.

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:03,100
But for the Cards what we want is one div which is going to have a class of card.

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,870
And then here we're going to have a class of card content.

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,820
OK and we'll save that and that gives us pretty much the simplest possible card that we can have over

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,870
here.

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:26,550
Let's add a color so we'll do a class card and it's given a color of red and we'll even darken it a

22
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:33,430
little so dark and two and then we'll give this a class of card content.

23
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:40,340
And we also want to give this white text so that it shows up on the dark red.

24
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,240
See I messed that up somehow.

25
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,220
Let's see.

26
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,210
Oh I put cards content should be card.

27
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:48,940
There we go.

28
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,830
So now we just have a red background and obviously you can use whatever colors you want whatever text

29
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,320
colors you want.

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,060
Now we're going to move down to the card with title that's this one right here.

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:08,310
So again classic card anytime we have any type of cards that will have that class and then we want the

32
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,520
card content.

33
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,040
Same thing.

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,940
And now for the span right here you see this is where we put the title it's in a span.

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,630
But we're going to give it a class of card title.

36
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,520
OK.

37
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,790
So let's save that.

38
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,740
And now you could see we have our title.

39
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,170
Now these links down here I want to add these links and we want to make these look good.

40
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,840
So this is going to be the action area.

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:45,010
So it will say class equals card dash action and save.

42
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:45,870
And there we go.

43
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,950
So that makes that look much better gives it some padding pushes it over.

44
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:59,330
Change the color also makes it all upper case so this is a card with a title and with an action area.

45
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,510
OK so the next one I'm going to look at is a card with an image.

46
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:09,920
So we're going to go down to this div here and give this a class of card using.

47
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,440
And we're also going to do right here.

48
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,540
We're not going to do the card content just yet.

49
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,520
We're going to do a class of card dash image.

50
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,890
OK if you want to put an image in here you want to wrap it in that class.

51
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,650
We don't really need an alt for the source.

52
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,990
I'm going to use my images folder.

53
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,270
I'm going to use image one dot j peg.

54
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,350
OK.

55
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:46,880
And let's see that's just the title so give the span a class of card title and then this div here we're

56
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:54,630
going to give a class of card content OK and then we have our action down here.

57
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,840
Card action so you can kind of mix and match.

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,630
I mean you don't have to have an action here but you can if you want just save that suit that looks

59
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,420
like.

60
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,100
All right so the title is going to be basically inside the image.

61
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,770
Now if you wanted the title in here what you could do is you could just kind of bring it down into the

62
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,820
card content like that.

63
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:17,590
OK.

64
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,250
But I actually like it.

65
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,290
I actually like it up here.

66
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,240
Where was it.

67
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,650
It was under the image.

68
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,810
That'll put it inside the image so we can also have a card with image and a floating button.

69
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:39,520
So maybe if you wanted like a link instead of having the read more you might want the floating button

70
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,790
link like right here so we could go.

71
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:52,300
Class equals card and this would be class equals card isn't going to make this a different color let's

72
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,760
say blue dash gray.

73
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,740
And let's say liten dash 4 or make it really light.

74
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,960
And they will put an image in here I'm going to say in the images folder.

75
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:13,080
I'm g to dot j peg in let's see we're going to show you know what I missed this.

76
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,520
I did this.

77
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,540
This here the lighting and the blue gray.

78
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:29,420
This should actually be on the card div so I'm going to cut that out and put that in here.

79
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,180
And then this should actually be card image like that.

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:33,990
OK.

81
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,250
And then we're going to go down here and this is where we're going to put our button.

82
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,090
So we're in a class equals member the beats and dash.

83
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,660
Floating class.

84
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:57,060
And we're going to say Half-Way dash fab so half way fixed action button will add the waves effect and

85
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:08,260
the waves light in and let's make it blue OK and then for the icon we put an add icon on the plus sign.

86
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,960
So add our material icons class.

87
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,620
All right now give us the button and then this div right here is the card content

88
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,250
we'll save that and that does not look right.

89
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:33,540
Let's see if we have our card class card image and then our span.

90
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,740
That's the span should have a card title.

91
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,720
Sure some of you guys caught that and will save.

92
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,070
And there we go so we have our title in the image and then we have the little button here.

93
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,800
So that could link to like the in her blog post or something like that.

94
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,270
OK so there's a lot of different ways you can format these cards.

95
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,430
Next thing we're going to look at is a horizontal card which we can put an image on the side instead

96
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,270
of on the top.

97
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:09,590
So let's go down to horizontal card and the first class are always going to add is card.

98
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,940
And then we're also going to add horizontal.

99
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,270
All right.

100
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:22,010
And then this div here we're going to have an image so we have to wrap it in the card image and for

101
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:31,010
the image itself let's go in the images folder and do image three thought jpeg and let's see this.

102
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:37,300
This right here we're actually going to do a class of card dash stack.

103
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:46,310
Ok if we want to do a horizontal card we need the stacked class and then the content comes so card content

104
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,740
and this will be the title.

105
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:57,110
So that will be class card dash title and you're not going to remember all this stuff right away you're

106
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,830
going to have to have something like this.

107
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:07,280
This sandbox as a reference to go back to to to make sure you have your right classes but let's save

108
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,980
that.

109
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,830
And that's what it gives us.

110
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:15,340
All right so if we were to make this bigger you can see the images the image stretches out.

111
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,720
And if we make it like really big it takes up the whole place.

112
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,810
OK the whole thing.

113
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,780
And you don't need to have a title in there.

114
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:32,390
If we were to take that title out in save you'll see that the will move up and it'll take less size

115
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,170
for the image to fill the whole place.

116
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:41,270
So next we're going to look at the card reveal which is really cool because it will hide the text and

117
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,350
then we can click the read more and it'll then slide up and show us.

118
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:53,750
So we're going to give this a class we're going to give this just a class of card and then we have an

119
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,970
image so we're going to do class card image.

120
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,760
And let's also do a Wavves effect

121
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:15,370
waves like these waves and then let's also do Wavves dash.

122
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:24,020
Block the waves block will make it so that when we hit the reveal the image will kind of get away from

123
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,840
the corner and we'll get sent down through the whole image and give it a nice effect.

124
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,150
All right.

125
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,550
So next thing we want to do is add in the image.

126
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:42,840
So it's two image for dart J peg and we're going to give this a class of activator.

127
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,980
Now the activator class is just that it'll activate the reveal module.

128
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,920
And when you actually see what it does it'll make more sense.

129
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,930
So it's a activator.

130
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,180
And then this will be the content.

131
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:07,250
So I will say class equals card content and then we have our title.

132
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,950
All right we'll have an icon.

133
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,020
Let's make this more Virts.

134
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:23,780
This is going to be kind of three vertical lines and give us a class of material icons.

135
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,240
All right.

136
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,750
And then we're going to go down here and we can add an activator to anything.

137
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:35,770
So I just want to show you that in addition to the image we give this a class to read more a class of

138
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,910
activator and that will also activate the reveal.

139
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,990
Now down here will be the inside of the reveal so when we click it.

140
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,380
This is the content that will display.

141
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:55,710
So we need to add the class of card reveal which initially hides it and then it'll show when we activate

142
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,450
it or we reveal it.

143
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,870
And then this will be the title.

144
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:07,950
So it's a C class equals card title

145
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,710
and for this icon this is going to be the close button because we want to be able to close it as well.

146
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,830
OK and then this here will be actually this paragraph doesn't need anything it doesn't need any kind

147
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,770
of class so let's save and see what that gives us.

148
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,040
All right.

149
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,610
So Carville and if I click the icon OK so the icons not working.

150
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,550
But if I click read more you'll see we get the revealed content.

151
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,210
Let me just see what's going on with this icon here.

152
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:50,700
All right.

153
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:56,230
So we want on the card title we want the activator class

154
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:06,990
ok because the the title or the more verts icon which is this right here is actually wrapped in the

155
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,090
span of the of the title.

156
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,040
So we need the activator on that.

157
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,700
So now if I click it it'll work OK.

158
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,930
And like I said you can add the activator to anything we have it on the image as well.

159
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,160
So if I click that that will reveal it too.

160
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,180
All right so now we're going to moved on move on to the tabbed card.

161
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,190
So go ahead and add our class of card

162
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:43,600
and this will be class of card content and then our card title

163
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:58,210
right and then down here we have a div and we want to give this a class of card tabs.

164
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:03,960
OK so at the bottom we have the card tabs div just like we have the card action if we want we can have

165
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,090
tabs.

166
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:11,110
And then for the UL we're going to have to give that a class or a couple classes.

167
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:19,920
One is tab's one is going to be tab's with fixed which is going to kind of spread them across the top

168
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,740
and then each ally is going to have a class of tab

169
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:42,490
cry and the traffic knows that they're going to tab one tab to tab three.

170
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,680
So what we want to do is these divs down here we want to associate these with those IDs so we're going

171
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:58,800
to say I.D. tab 1 and this will be the tab too because we want these to show when those particular ones

172
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,720
are clicked.

173
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,160
So Tab 3.

174
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,650
All right.

175
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:09,570
And then it's you know it's just let's save that.

176
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,320
And then if we go down here we can look at the tabs card.

177
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,340
OK.

178
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,430
So the tabs are working but the content doesn't look right.

179
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:23,670
That's because this div wrapping it should have the card content that's what adds the padding and all

180
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,270
that stuff.

181
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,820
So save that.

182
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,970
And now that looks a lot better.

183
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:34,420
Now let's say we wanted to add a background color to this card in the tabs.

184
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:45,540
What I'm going to do is copy the entire tabbed card which is from there to there and we'll go down here

185
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,390
and let's replace this stuff.

186
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,900
This is all the same thing.

187
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,790
I just we're running out of time here and I don't have to retype it all out but all we have to do is

188
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:07,990
let's add to this div here the actual card will add a color of orange and we'll say Darkon and let's

189
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,290
give it white text.

190
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,240
OK.

191
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:20,430
Save that now for this right here this area I want to make this black so we'll go down to where you

192
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,460
want to go down to the UL and we're going to add.

193
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,200
First of all we're going to add tabs dash transparent because you can see that they're white it's white

194
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,410
by default.

195
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:39,410
So we'll save and now it's transparent and you can see the background color.

196
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,540
But what I want to do is actually make the content black not that part.

197
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,320
I want to make the content black.

198
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:53,500
So right here we'll say black and let's do actually will lighten it a little bit will say liten dash

199
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,620
for sort of be like a gray ish.

200
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,380
And then let's add white.

201
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,580
It's already white text.

202
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,670
And then we go.

203
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:07,510
So now we have kind of a Halloween looking card tabbed card.

204
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,240
All right so now we're going to move on to card sizes.

205
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,180
So if we go down here we're going to have three image cards.

206
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,570
So what I'll do.

207
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:26,250
Let's see instead of just typing all this so let's copy the first image card we did which is right here

208
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,940
card with image.

209
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:41,980
So grab from here to here and let's go back down to sizes and we'll go to the small so this div ends

210
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:49,450
here so we're just going to pace that in let's do it for the next one so this div here which ends right

211
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:57,580
here pace that in the large one we'll paste that in.

212
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,990
Let's change the images.

213
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,510
So the first one will be image five.

214
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,300
Will be six and this will be seven.

215
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,710
All right so if we save that we have our card images.

216
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:17,440
Now what I want to do is show you that we can actually make the small medium and large just by adding

217
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:24,430
a simple class to the card div here so we'll say small and save and you'll see it'll shrink it up.

218
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:31,360
Now it's going to cover some syntax so you might want to shorten your text but Or if it doesn't matter

219
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,550
if it's covered then you could leave it and just click read more go to the blog post or whatever.

220
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,320
This one here we're going to set to Medium.

221
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:46,310
So we'll save that and you'll see that that gets a little shorter.

222
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:52,340
I put that on the right medium.

223
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,370
And then let's do small.

224
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,990
I did so also we want to do large OK.

225
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,640
So there we go.

226
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,190
So small medium large you can basically just change the heights of these things.

227
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:15,360
OK so down here what I want to do is show you about panels and also shadow shadow is separate from cards

228
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,710
you can put shadow on anything but I just figured this was a good place to display it.

229
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:29,370
Basically a panel is kind of like what we have up here just a border with the drop shadow except it

230
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,310
only takes one class instead of the card and the card content.

231
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:40,810
It just takes the class of card panel so I can say Card dash panel and save.

232
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,130
And there we go.

233
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:42,930
All right.

234
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:48,950
So let's see we're going to add that to all of these.

235
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,450
You know it's a class

236
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,420
card panel.

237
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:12,900
And this one here.

238
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,180
All right so if you just want like a border and some padding and stuff like that you should probably

239
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,620
use card panel instead of card and card content.

240
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:30,990
So let's add some colors to these so for this first one here we'll see a blue.

241
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:36,800
And for this one make sure it's on the card panel class not the actual column.

242
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:46,930
So for this one let's say indigo and we'll do Suyin and it's to Amber and save.

243
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,920
And now we have a bunch different colors for the darker ones like say Indigo you probably want the text

244
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,550
to be white.

245
00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:01,560
So for this span right here I'm just going to add a class of white dash text and save.

246
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,890
And there we go.

247
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,850
Now for the shadow there's just a couple of classes and there Z depth classes so if we were to do Z

248
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:20,220
dash dash dash one on the blue and save you'll see there's no difference.

249
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,910
So the depth one is basically just.

250
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:30,650
Well actually these have a shadow by default so it's going to be like that default shadow.

251
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,280
If we do too it should look a little more prominent as you can see it's now a little more prominent

252
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,880
for this one here.

253
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:44,450
Let's do Z dash Deppe dash three and save.

254
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,810
And that's even more prominent.

255
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:56,610
And then for this one will do Z dash depth dash for and that has an even thicker shadow.

256
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,050
OK and I believe four is the highest we can go.

257
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,430
OK.

258
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,670
So that's how we can add shadows and you can do that on buttons you can do that on anything.

259
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:13,910
But most of this stuff has as that kind of a default shadow that's that's just the material design look.

260
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,600
But you can make that shadow thicker with these ZDF depth classes.

261
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,050
All right guys so this was kind of a long one.

262
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:24,680
This is because there's a lot of different types of cards that you can do.

263
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,720
So that's it.

264
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,200
In the next video we're going to take a look at breadcrumbs and flooder.
