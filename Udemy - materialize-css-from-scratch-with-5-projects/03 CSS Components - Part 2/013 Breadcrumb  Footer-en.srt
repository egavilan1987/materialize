1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,910
Guys who now are going to take a look at breadcrumbs in footer.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:10,650
So these are actually components that you usually want to stretch all the way across so noticed at the

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,530
start here is actually below the container.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,660
So that way it goes all the way across and it's not restricted inside the container and the breadcrumb

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,420
is very very similar to a nav bar.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,000
It's structured pretty much the same way we have our NAV tag and actually just going to give it a class

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,130
of grey to change the color and we're going to give it the Nav. wrapper class which just like all nav

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,000
bars gets this class.

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,130
OK.

10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:46,800
And let's also give it a container so that the words aren't stuck up to the side.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,730
OK so that pushes those over and then we have our div here.

12
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:59,080
Now this I'm actually going to give this div a class of call and s 12.

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,450
OK.

14
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,460
So just a 12 column row.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,650
And then for each of these eight tags here we're going to do class equals breadcrumb and that'll spread

16
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,170
them out a bit and just make them look much better.

17
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,910
So it's a class

18
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,880
all right so let's save that.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,690
And then we go so that breadcrumb adds these icons here and it does that by adding maybe four pseudo

20
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:41,840
class so it can actually put content before we go right here.

21
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:47,380
So before and you'll see it has the code for the content that will give it the arrow.

22
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:55,670
So using the the material icons font family the font size they're 25 pixels.

23
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:01,820
And then the actual text is 18 pixels.

24
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,020
It just adds a little bit of padding and stuff.

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,450
So that's a breadcrumb very very easy.

26
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:15,020
And what's cool is automatically that the last link was automatically lighter than these ones because

27
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,730
you would be on the instance the Bradd profile.

28
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,220
All right then you would have this go to your users page which displays all your users and then your

29
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,380
home page would be here.

30
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:34,070
All right so let's let's now create a foreigner or so you can see I just have just blank footer tags

31
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,690
here.

32
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,050
We're just going to create this from scratch.

33
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,040
So there's a class we can use called Page Footer.

34
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,030
OK.

35
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,470
And we want to give us a color or I'm going to make it gray and I to say dark and dash 3.

36
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:58,760
So I'll make it a dark gray and inside here let's put a container and let's use the grid system so we'll

37
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,240
put a row and let's do let's see what we want to do.

38
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,480
We'll do 12.

39
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,620
So we want it stacked on small screens.

40
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,050
We also want the call class.

41
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:19,250
So call us 12 and let's do all 6 so large six.

42
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:30,450
And inside here we'll put in age five and let's just say about us and we'll give this age five color

43
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:36,200
we don't have to do this stuff but I figure we'll just kind of do this throughout the course so that

44
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,890
you're constantly reminded of how to add colors and stuff like that how to lighten it all that all that

45
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,340
good stuff.

46
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,220
All right so give it great text and let's lighten it up.

47
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:54,380
Say Leitung three.

48
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,920
And then under the age five I'm going to put a paragraph with some dummy text on just going to do Lorem

49
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:07,240
20 tab which will give us some dummy text so we'll save that.

50
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,800
See you know what let's do six.

51
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:20,690
So that on medium screen it's also six columns and then underneath this column we're going to do the

52
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,850
next one which will be it will have the class call.

53
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:37,010
It'll have let's do as 12 and let's do let's see em for.

54
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:46,760
Yeah we'll do em four but let's offset it by two because we have 6 4 which is 10 and we want to offset

55
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:55,990
it by 2 so we'll say offset dash em to dash and 2.

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,580
All right.

57
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:04,040
And then and here let's put in each five again and let's say Lenk So this will be just a list of links

58
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:13,180
We'll also give this a class of gray or I'm sorry gray text and let's see.

59
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:21,910
Actually this should be text liten since it's just text it's not the background to the same thing here.

60
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:40,000
K and see underneath that let's do a UL and we'll do a bunch of lies to say Ally times for using Amut.

61
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,780
And inside the I'm going to have an eight tag.

62
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,660
So having a tag in this will have a class of white dash text

63
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,940
and let's make this the we'll just say link one.

64
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,280
All right.

65
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,500
So I'm actually going to just copy that line.

66
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:15,980
And we'll go ahead and paste isn't pretty or will format these so we don't have to worry about that.

67
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,020
If you're using prettier and let's change this to four

68
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,970
three and two.

69
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,900
OK so those are links.

70
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,640
Now I also want to have like a copyright area underneath.

71
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,960
So we want to go.

72
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,410
Let's see where do we want to go.

73
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,680
We want to go under the container

74
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:56,600
also under the container which is right here and we're going to put a class of water dash copyright

75
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:05,210
and we'll put another container in here to restrict whatever's inside of it and then inside there we're

76
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:11,540
just going to say copyrights and I'm going to use the Ampere's copy semi-colon which will give us a

77
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,490
little copy symbol 2018.

78
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,590
And then underneath that we'll just put in a tag with the class of grey text.

79
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:26,670
And let's also do text liten 3.

80
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,870
And we also want to align it to the right and when to say Dot right.

81
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,610
And inside here it's not going to really go anywhere.

82
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,920
I'll just put a hash and then inside the actual tags we'll just say.

83
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,240
Terms and Conditions.

84
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,130
And there he goes.

85
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:53,740
Now we have a little flutter now I think it would look better if the copyright area was a little darker

86
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,170
or just a different color.

87
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,710
So what I'm going to do is in the copyright class still do Grey.

88
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,880
But let's say Darkon dash to and save.

89
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,710
All right so I think that yeah it looks better.

90
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,160
Yes so that's it.

91
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,930
So we have a photo or if I make this really small it'll stack on top of each other because we use the

92
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:24,460
s 12 class here and we have quite a bit of space between the two because we set this one to be medium

93
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,610
for and then we used an offset of two.

94
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,660
So it's kind of pushing it over a little.

95
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:37,300
We could have just did another six like M6 and say but see how it's it's too close.

96
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,480
I wanted to push it over a little so it's good to set that offset.

97
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,240
All right guys so that's going to be it for this video in the next one we're going to talk about basic

98
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,310
form and input.

99
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:55,270
So once we do that we'll move on to the more fancy stuff with sliders and some javascript functionality

100
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,080
and so on.

101
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,860
All right so I will see you in the next video.
