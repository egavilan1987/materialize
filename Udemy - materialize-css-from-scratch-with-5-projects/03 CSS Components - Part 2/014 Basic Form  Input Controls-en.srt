1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,530
All right guys who we're going to start to look at forms and inputs and we're going to be doing this

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,680
for this lecture and the next one.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,010
The next one will do.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,770
Some of the more fancy stuff but this is the file called Three underscore three forms dot HMO.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,350
All right so we're going to close that up and we're going to go down to where it says Start here and

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,750
we just have a form with some divs and then inside those divs we have an input and a label.

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,710
OK now materializes one of those frameworks where the the the inputs actually look pretty decent without

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,450
having to do anything at all to them.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,200
There's no materialized classes or anything it just looks like this by default with the exception of

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,360
the text area which doesn't.

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,370
But for these like for instance the textfield there's not really anything we really have to add here

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,820
as far as classes or anything like that.

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,580
We have an input with a placeholder an ID the label has a four attribute which should match the ID that's

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:03,570
not materialized It's just standard HVM owl so that if you click on the label it'll actually refer to

15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,460
that of that field.

16
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:12,930
All right one thing we do want to do is wrap these divs or add to the divs the class of input field

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,360
and save.

18
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,260
And let's see what that did.

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:25,170
So if we go and we look at the input field div which is right here let's see what that includes It makes

20
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,160
it relative.

21
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,900
It gives it a margin top.

22
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,290
So it kind of moves it down a little bit but that's that's about it.

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,200
I think it may be used in job for javascript for something but I think that's about it.

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,370
So we just want to make sure that we add that class for all of these divs.

25
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,610
So this will be class input fields.

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,070
Now for this for this example I want to show you how to how we can add a value.

27
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,680
This is just standard reached him.

28
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:06,570
So let's say we wanted the value of whatever Jaun at gmail dot com save and that will be filled.

29
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,380
And then to disable it we just want to add a disabled

30
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,960
disabled attribute like that in a class with an attribute and save.

31
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:23,110
And now we can't edit that but that's not materialize I'm just showing you how it looks and materialize.

32
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,680
Nothing we did here is specific to the framework.

33
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,100
All right.

34
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,930
Now for the text area you can see this doesn't look right compared to the rest of these.

35
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,830
So what we have to do with text areas is we need to add a class

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,900
of materialized text area

37
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,570
dash text area.

38
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,250
All right so once they do that and they save now you can see the text area looks good.

39
00:02:52,950 --> 00:03:00,760
And let's also give the div a class of input field.

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,180
All right.

41
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,660
Now this next one is an inline field.

42
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,080
OK.

43
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,560
Which it isn't right now but we're going to make it into an inline field and we do that by adding to

44
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:17,560
this class or adding to this div a class of input field just like the rest but we're also going to add

45
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,870
the class of inline.

46
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,190
All right.

47
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,300
So by doing that we'll be able to make this in line.

48
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,350
And that should be Dasch field input Desch field in line and then we use.

49
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,920
Now you can see it's on the same level as the text.

50
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,920
OK.

51
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,180
Or the label.

52
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,740
Actually it's on a label it's just the text here.

53
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,360
The label is this actual number sign.

54
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,470
And you can see it moves up when I click in it which is pretty cool.

55
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,040
In fact any of these if we don't have a placeholder.

56
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:58,050
So for instance let's go to the name and remove the placeholder and save now the label is right on the

57
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:03,080
input and if I click it moves up OK it moves up and down.

58
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,640
So I'll leave that placeholder off just as an example.

59
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,970
So that's in line.

60
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,630
Let's see.

61
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,410
Let's go to the icon prefix if we want to add a prefix.

62
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:21,140
First of all let's give it the input field div and then we're going to go right before.

63
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,950
This is for a telephone number.

64
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:32,940
So I'm going to put in I tag with the class of material icons and then we're going to use the phone

65
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,680
icon.

66
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,670
OK.

67
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,260
Now that alone looks crappy.

68
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:49,740
So we want to add to this material icons class prefix and save and now it kind of pushes the input over

69
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,650
and it puts it in place.

70
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,290
All right so now what I want to do is look at some validation.

71
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:02,250
Now this is just UI validation it's looking like stop us from submitting the form or anything but let's

72
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,150
say this email address right here which is this input.

73
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:12,900
It has to be an email address and it's going to go off of the age of 5 validation because we have type

74
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,950
e-mail.

75
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,680
So what we can do is we can add actually first of all we need to add our input field class or this won't

76
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,000
work right.

77
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,970
And then we're going to add a class to the input of validate.

78
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,210
Now just having that if I were to put something in here that's not an e-mail address and click out.

79
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,880
You'll see that the line turns red.

80
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,820
Now if we want a message what we can do is where the label is.

81
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,610
We can say data Dasch error equals.

82
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,430
And let's just say

83
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,560
invalid.

84
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:02,190
And then we can save data Dasch success equals valid.

85
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,200
So we'll save that.

86
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:10,790
And now if I click and I put something that's not valid and click outside we get the text invalid.

87
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:17,960
If I put something that is a valid email address and then click outside we get valid.

88
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,540
So we do have some UI validation we can do without even having to touch javascript or anything like

89
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,190
that.

90
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,650
All right so that is pretty nice.

91
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,790
Next we're going to look at select lists.

92
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,590
OK now what are you going to do here is we just have a div.

93
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:42,600
Give it the class of input field and let's give this select some options.

94
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:52,430
So I'll say option actually we'll just add let's say option times for tab and for this one it's going

95
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,970
to be disabled because it's just like the type.

96
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,420
Kind of like the title.

97
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:03,130
We're going to make it selected by default and it's just going to say select option.

98
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:03,900
OK.

99
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,840
And then for the options we'll just say one doesn't really matter.

100
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:19,590
Option 1 2 3 option 2 and option 3.

101
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,500
Okay.

102
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,830
And then if I save this notice that we we can't see it you don't see any select list.

103
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:31,100
That's because with materialized when we use a select list you actually have to initialize it in the

104
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,070
javascript.

105
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:38,810
OK with Jay query so we need to go to the bottom down here where it says javascript's start here.

106
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,390
OK.

107
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,170
Notice we are already in the document d'arte ready for Jay query.

108
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,160
This obviously is just for the dropdown for our menu right here.

109
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:58,760
This is on every page but what we want to do is we want to initialize the select with us and we do that

110
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:06,830
by using Jey query and just taking the Select that's on the page and we're going to call Daut material

111
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:13,670
underscore select like that it's going to call that special function.

112
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,890
And now we can see it.

113
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,810
And if I click it we get the dropdown.

114
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,870
OK.

115
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,920
So we need to add that in order to initialize this.

116
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,730
And it also initialize these other selects that we have which we don't we actually don't have any options

117
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,280
for yet.

118
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,370
So the next one I want to show is option groups.

119
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:40,920
So what I'll do is actually just copy the select list we just put in and let's just let's change this

120
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,570
to multiple select lists just so we know what it is.

121
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,370
Actually no this isn't a multiple select.

122
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,650
This is this is option groups

123
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:01,210
option group select and what we want is just different groups of options.

124
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:11,590
So let's take a here story here and let's say actually you know let's get rid of this

125
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:24,440
and then let's do opt groups like that should give us a tag I guess.

126
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,940
M-ID isn't going to work with that so it should be opt group and then we're going to give it a label

127
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:42,450
of let's say Option Group 1 and then we want to wrap a certain set of options so we'll just take one

128
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,700
and two and wrap that.

129
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,760
OK and then let's actually just copy this whole thing.

130
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,990
Paste it there.

131
00:09:51,990 --> 00:10:02,830
This will be group 2 and then this will be three and four that so let's save and now if I were to click

132
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:08,020
this we have Option Group 1 we have two options option group 2.

133
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,650
Ok so you can kind of separate your options into groups.

134
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,900
Next thing we'll look at is multiple select So what I'm going to do is copy the regular select we have

135
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:26,820
and just place it in there and then all we have to do to make this a multiple select is just as on right

136
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,100
here multiple night class multiple.

137
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,200
But just a multiple attribute.

138
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,890
And now we can go ahead and select different options.

139
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,190
Kind of like a radio box inside of your select list.

140
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,700
All right.

141
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,120
So speaking of radio let's do those next.

142
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,100
So we're just going to go ahead and put in

143
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:58,370
we're going to put in some paragraph tags in each one I want an input and this is going to have a type

144
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,220
of radio.

145
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,860
OK so we don't need a name

146
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,390
actually.

147
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,790
Yeah we'll just keep the name.

148
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:16,710
So we'll say this is for gender since it's an input radio we should have a name I.D. we'll see say male

149
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:35,980
and let's put a label a label for say so label for whatever the idea is which will say it may not may

150
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,930
al will go like that.

151
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:48,620
All right so there we have one radio button now just copy this and this one will be female.

152
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,390
And we'll save that.

153
00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:00,010
And there we go so we have our radio buttons if we wanted one to be checked by default.

154
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,080
Obviously we could just put a check to attribute that's just standard now.

155
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:10,130
Another thing we can do is we can change how the Although Phil looks so it takes the whole thing up

156
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,580
if we want we can add to the radio input.

157
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:20,210
A class of with Dash gap and save.

158
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,190
Now if I check this one see that looks different and has the gap around it.

159
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,920
So we can change how that looks as well.

160
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:28,760
All right.

161
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:36,140
So next we're going to look at checkboxes so very similar We're going to put in our paragraphs and let's

162
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,720
say inputs.

163
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:47,370
Type is going to be a checkbox and see let's say ID.

164
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:54,850
Each team will go out and just put some languages in here or technologies for name we'll just say tech

165
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:06,660
and let's put a label you know save for HVM how and save.

166
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,520
Now we have a little check box and it has that cool animation by default.

167
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:20,160
So it's copy this paragraph and I want to put a couple more put three more and then this one let's make

168
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,840
this C Ss

169
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,280
and for this one I'm going to just make this one checked by default.

170
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,800
Just kind of give me a couple of different examples.

171
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,980
That's checked.

172
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:39,210
And then for this one let's call it J.S.

173
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:53,430
and what I'm going to do is give this one a class of filled dash in and save.

174
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,440
And now this one it has a different effect.

175
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,310
You see how it doesn't flip like the default.

176
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:04,680
It just kind of it fills the whole thing and dark and it doesn't do the little flip.

177
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,920
And then for the last one here we'll make this ph P

178
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:22,830
and what I want to do is disable this one so I'm just going to put in disabled and save and you see

179
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,420
that checkbox is disabled.

180
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,910
So just a couple of different options that you can do with your checkboxes.

181
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,620
All right so those are the basic form elements.

182
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:37,380
Next we're going to get into more fancy things like Sliders and ranges and things like that.

183
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,980
We'll also be working with javascript a little bit.
