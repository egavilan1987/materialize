1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,180
So in the last video we looked at some of the just the basic input fields like just text inputs text

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,800
areas select lists.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:15,630
Now we're going to look at things like switches range sliders file uploads and we're going to also do

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:22,370
a little bit of Javascript and Jay query to initialize stuff and also give you show you some options.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,970
Because some of this stuff can take options as well.

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,760
All right so we're going to start off with the switch so if we go where it says start here this is file

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,090
3:4 forms underscore to daughter aged male and for the switch.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:45,000
I just have a set of divs here and we're going to add a class of switch and inside the switch we put

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,320
a label and we don't actually need a four attribute inside the label we're going to say disable and

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,780
put an end to it.

11
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:04,820
So this input it's actually going to be the type of checkbox because each Jim'll doesn't actually have

12
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,000
a switch input so it will be checkbox and then we're going to put it to check out

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,740
like that.

14
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,260
OK.

15
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:25,020
And then what we do is put a span underneath and give it a Class Scott class of lever OK nothing inside

16
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,850
just the span and then we can put in the table.

17
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,190
So you have to structure it like this in order for it to work so it's save.

18
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,240
And that gives us a little switch and we can switch it on and off.

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,780
So this is something that is common on like mobile apps.

20
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,050
Now the check is what turns it on.

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,800
If I were to take away checked it'll be disabled by default but we can still turn it on.

22
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,290
All right.

23
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:57,320
Let's see so I have disabled switch here that would just be the same thing except it wouldn't have checked

24
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,910
OK so that's a disabled switch.

25
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,120
So now let's take a look at file input.

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:11,330
So this is the standard looking each time I'll file input and you can see here I just have an input

27
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,160
with the type of file.

28
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,520
So I have the text input with the type of text underneath because what materialized does it makes it

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:28,280
so that when you choose a file that saves vs code setup file we want this right here the name of the

30
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,710
file to be put on the text.

31
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:41,630
Ok so what we need to do is first wrap this div or wrap this in a div called Fylde dash field and also

32
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:49,490
input Dasch field and I forgot the class.

33
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,360
All right.

34
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,690
And then this div here we're going to give a class of button because we want it to look like a materialized

35
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:09,240
button and down here this div that's around the text the input text we're going to give this a class

36
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,230
of file paff wrapper.

37
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:26,550
And then the input itself is going to have a class of file paff and a type of text.

38
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,760
So let's save that.

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,620
And it should look like this.

40
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:35,220
Now once we choose a file it gets put onto that line which looks really nice.

41
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:42,960
I really like the look of materialized file inputs are going to reload that to get rid of that file

42
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:49,280
name and let's move on to the slider so we have the input type range which is actually an H team out

43
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:57,580
element but it looks really cool and materialize if we wanted to add to it like a man and a max value

44
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:13,540
we could say men equals zero Max equals 100 and all we need to actually add to the inclosing element

45
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,410
the class of range field

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,350
OK.

47
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:25,410
So now when I slide it you can actually see the number as it pops up which is really cool when I let

48
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,530
go it goes away.

49
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,650
All right.

50
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,930
So next thing we're going to look at is the date picker.

51
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,820
OK so this is actually going to take some javascript.

52
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:44,340
I don't think there's anything we need to really add here aside from the input field class.

53
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:52,590
Yes so all we need to do now is go to I mean right now it's just a text field right with an idea of

54
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,630
date.

55
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,510
So let's go down to our javascript

56
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,850
and we're going to say in net date picker.

57
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,520
So we're going to use a little bit of a query.

58
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:17,670
It should have a class of date picker and then we're going to say Daut pick a date.

59
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:23,650
OK that's the name of the function takes in an object of options and we just make sure we have that

60
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:29,840
class C date picker.

61
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,480
No we don't.

62
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,860
So we just want to add that as a class

63
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:46,680
OK so go back down here and there's this quite a bit of options here.

64
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:55,740
So for instance we have an option called select months and this will create a drop down to control of

65
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,830
the month let's say.

66
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,070
True.

67
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,760
And let's actually save that and if I click we're going to get something like this.

68
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:14,800
So we have our our calendar basically we have our months and then if we click the years we'll see actually

69
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,540
oh you know what we can add is an option is select years

70
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:35,610
and we put this as a number let's say 15 and now it'll give us up to 15 years of date.

71
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,160
OK we can also add the option of to day.

72
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:47,810
And if we said that to today a string of today let's see what that does.

73
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,700
So that's going to give this right here it's going to say today and we can just market OK which is pretty

74
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,050
cool.

75
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:03,520
We can also add the clear actually the clear it's there by default do we even need today.

76
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,890
We might not even need this.

77
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,330
No we don't we don't need that.

78
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:16,900
We'll see what else enclose it by clicking outside of it.

79
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:23,790
We can also make it so that it can close when we select a date so it doesn't close.

80
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,810
Let's go ahead and do that.

81
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:37,600
So add an option here of close on select and we'll set that to true soon now.

82
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,660
So now if I click here and I select the day it just closes automatically so you can set that to True

83
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,020
or false it's false by default.

84
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,310
All right so that's the date picker.

85
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,790
Now we also have a time picker so we're going to go up here and let's add a class just like we added

86
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:01,180
the date picker class we're going to add time picker and then we're going to go down to the javascript

87
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,190
and we're going to grab it with Jay query

88
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,500
OK and the function we want is just like pick a day we have pick a time

89
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,850
OK that takes in an object and we can have different options in here.

90
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,220
So if we save that it should work.

91
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:33,100
If I say choose a time actually it's this one here and you can see it's at 12.

92
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:39,480
Now I want the default to be the the now time where ever time it is right now so we can see default

93
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,600
and set that to now and let's save.

94
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,550
And now if I go and click on the field it's going to have the time right now.

95
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:49,860
All right.

96
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,410
So some other stuff we can do is we can change it to a 24 hour clock if we want.

97
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:05,840
So if we say 12 hour and we can set that to false so now you'll see that it's a 24 hour clock.

98
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,110
OK but I don't want that.

99
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,500
So you could either just get rid of the option or set it to true.

100
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,110
You can also change the text.

101
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:22,720
So for instance the done text we have the done text we have the clear text

102
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:32,230
and we have apps we have the cancell text.

103
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:41,420
So that would be this is the done the cancel in the clear so let's say done I want it to be go clear.

104
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,570
I don't know.

105
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:48,640
I will just test it out we'll just say a race and then canso will say leave.

106
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,270
So let's save let's go back and then we go race leave go so you can change that up.

107
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,140
But I'm going to just leave it at the default which was OK.

108
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:12,060
Clear actually only I don't think we actually need to uppercase it that's done in the styling.

109
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,860
Try that.

110
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,970
And there you go.

111
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:15,680
All right.

112
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:21,050
We can also do auto close with this so if we choose a time it should auto close.

113
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,950
If we have that option.

114
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,510
So it's a little close.

115
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,980
True.

116
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:37,110
And I'll choose a time and it closes automatically.

117
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,610
All right so that's the time picker.

118
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,920
The next thing we're going to look at is let's go back up here.

119
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,840
It's going to be the character counter.

120
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:52,010
OK so right here we have this text field which has a label of post.

121
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,300
I wanted to count the characters like you would on like Twitter or something where you can only have

122
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,800
whatever it is 120 characters and it shows you the amount of characters so to do that.

123
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:13,710
All we have to do is add to the text field a data length property and let's say this can only be 20

124
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:19,470
characters and we'll save and let's click in here and right away it's 0 to 20.

125
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,750
And I can start typing as soon as I get to 20.

126
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,330
It turns red.

127
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,290
OK.

128
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:31,340
So that's pretty nice functionality just by adding this right here this attribute value.

129
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,500
So now do the auto complete.

130
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:39,180
So what I have here is just a text in a text input called fruit.

131
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,940
What I'm going to do is add a class to the text input and I'm going to call it auto complete

132
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:59,430
and then we're going to go down to our javascript's and from here we want to initialize that.

133
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,870
OK.

134
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:11,910
So to do this we're going to take the autocomplete class and we're going to call Daut auto complete

135
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,890
and pass in an object and then it's going to take in a data object.

136
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,290
OK so this is where we want to put the text for the data.

137
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,700
Now this is fruit's I'm going to say apple.

138
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:31,070
And we just want to set these to null by default.

139
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,420
So orange

140
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:42,200
and I'm just going to copy these down.

141
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,810
So say orange

142
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,270
say Strawberry's

143
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,180
peers and plumbs.

144
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:05,740
All right.

145
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,070
So we have our data and we can actually set a limit

146
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,600
so let's set a limit of 20.

147
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,380
And I think I think that's good.

148
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,780
Let's save and let's go down here and let's take in a and then we go.

149
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:31,320
So anything that has an A in it in this list will pop up and obviously you can do like a fecche request

150
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:38,040
to an API and get some data put it in here whether it's your own API or an external one and you can

151
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,110
have auto complete.

152
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,290
So if I put a p it's going to narrow it down to anything with a P.

153
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,840
I put a p p narrows it down to Apple.

154
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,810
And if I click Apple it's going to put that right in.

155
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,160
All right.

156
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,810
So really nice feature.

157
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,590
You can also change the minimum length for the auto complete to start.

158
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,710
So if I say min length of the fault is 1 but let's make it two.

159
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:12,220
So now if I put an A in like this yes that doesn't mean length or this should be an upper case at all.

160
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,350
All right so if I put a.

161
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:20,310
Nothing happens if I do P though it does K because it takes a minimum of two to start the auto complete.

162
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:25,020
All right guys that's going to do it for this video in the next video we're going to get into tables

163
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,070
as well as media.

164
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:31,950
So embedding images responsive images videos things like that.
