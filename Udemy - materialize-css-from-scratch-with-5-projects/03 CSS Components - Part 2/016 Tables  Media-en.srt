1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,880
All right guys in this video we're going to take a look at tables and some media elements like images

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:12,960
and embedded videos so tables they actually look pretty good by default you can see that we have three

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,760
tables here.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,440
No classes or anything.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,490
This is just what they look like by default in materialize.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,240
All right so that's the first table.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,600
The second one I'm going to give it a class of striped and if you're familiar with bootstrap it basically

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,680
does the same thing.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,630
It'll make every other row a light gray color.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,590
OK so that looks pretty nice.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,700
Nice and clean.

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,910
And then this third table I'm actually going to do a couple things too.

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,210
So first I'm going to give it a class of bordered and see what that does.

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,770
So what that does is it basically puts a line underneath each row.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,650
OK so gives you a border for each row.

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,760
We can also give it a class of highlight.

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,250
If I do that initially you'll see it looks like there's no change.

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,060
But if I go in I highlight over a row it'll turn dark gray or light gray rather.

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,400
All right.

20
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,470
So it allows us to do that.

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,180
Another class we have is responsive table.

22
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,110
So it's a responsive Dasch table and save.

23
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,320
And notice that it completely changes the way it looks it basically puts the headings on the side here

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,370
and then it puts the data in a column.

25
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:26,700
All right.

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,160
That way no matter how small this is we can just have a scroll bar and we can see all the different

27
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,990
columns and all the data.

28
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:34,370
All right.

29
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,890
Now in this case these tables only have three columns so this doesn't look bad.

30
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,540
This actually looks better than this in my opinion.

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,390
But imagine if there were five six seven columns it would look horrible all squished together.

32
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,480
But if they're responsive you would have these nice rows and you can just scroll through.

33
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,080
All right so it doesn't look the best but it's very very difficult to get a table to look good on a

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,960
small screen.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,380
OK so that's tables.

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,420
Next thing I want to do is look at responsive images.

37
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:11,680
So first thing I'm going to do right here is just put in an image let's say image slash image one dot

38
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,720
j peg and save it.

39
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,930
And by default it's just going to give us the full size image which is huge.

40
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,080
We have to scroll over to see the whole thing.

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,130
Now if we want to restrict this let's say we want to wrap this in a column.

42
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:36,300
So what we're going to do is put a let's do 6 column div and then just take this image here and let's

43
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,890
put that up here and save and it's still basically bursting out of its container.

44
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,220
A six column div ends like right here.

45
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,630
So what we want to do is constrain it into its container.

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:59,880
So to do that we give it a class of responsive dash I am g and save.

47
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,800
And now you see that it's restricted into its container.

48
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,320
OK if this was let's say a and 8 column actually will do a 12 we'll just do a full column and you see

49
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,890
it's constrained inside.

50
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,980
OK.

51
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:24,120
Now we can also make circular images so if I were to take this and just add a class of circle and save

52
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,000
it makes it a circle or an oval shape which looks really cool.

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,510
If we want to do a video or an embedded video rather I'm going to just paste in I-frame for a YouTube

54
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,500
video it's just my channel trailer and save it.

55
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:47,070
Now I have it set to 853 by for 80 and you'll see it just goes off the page I have to scroll over if

56
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:53,610
I wanted this to be responsive and restricted to its container I could wrap it in a class called video

57
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,430
dash container.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,330
All right.

59
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:04,860
So I'll just grab this and we'll just move this up into here and save.

60
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,860
And now you can see it's restricted no matter how big or small I make this it's going to show the whole

61
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,090
video.

62
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,800
All right.

63
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:18,480
And then for this last one here the video element I don't actually have a local video to use but I'm

64
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,160
just going to show you the mark up.

65
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:27,350
So what we would do is have a video tag with the class of responsive dash video

66
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:38,830
and we wouldn't put the source here what we would do is inside the video we'll put a source tag and

67
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:48,220
then on that will put the source attribute and it would be set to some video it could be an MP 4 MP

68
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,390
4 or an API or something like that.

69
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:51,760
All right.

70
00:04:51,780 --> 00:05:00,730
And we just want to give this a type of video slash and then whatever the type in this case an MP for.

71
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:07,240
All right so if I save that that nothing is going to show because I don't have the video.

72
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:13,300
But if we were to put a controls attribute here you know see the controls are in there.

73
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,950
All right.

74
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,360
And if you want to try putting a video locally inside your folder that's fine.

75
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,000
All right.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,580
So not much to do here.

77
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,680
There's not too many different table classes.

78
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,010
Not as many as bootstrap media.

79
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,080
Pretty pretty self-explanatory.

80
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:36,150
Just use responsive image response video and they'll get restricted to their containers.

81
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,030
All right so in the next video we're going to take a look at chips and pagination.
