1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,150
All right guys who in this video we're going to talk about what are called chips in materialize.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,270
And we're also going to look at pagination so chips are basically like tag's if you see a blog post

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:18,120
and it has tags at the end basically containing key words about that post.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,140
Chips are good.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,750
A good way to display those.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,340
All right so let's see we had a blog post about web design web development and we had some keywords

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:27,990
here.

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,330
They're just wrapped in single divs.

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,190
What we could do is give these each a class of chip.

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,140
All right so give that a class.

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:47,620
This one will say class chip and this one will also give a class of ship and just doing.

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,490
Now if I save you'll see that that looks pretty nice.

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:56,540
So if we have this at the bottom of a post it looks nice it's a nice way to display tags.

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,230
Now we can also make it so that we can get rid of them we can actually close them out.

15
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:11,760
So again if we were to give these class of chip and I'll just copy this div here and will add it to

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,570
these.

17
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,440
And then also have an icon.

18
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:27,080
So this will do class and will give it a class of material dash icons and clothes.

19
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,820
All right so let's grab that and put those here as well.

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,840
If I say we have our little X now just doing that isn't going to make them work it's not going at all.

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,970
It's also not going to make them look right.

22
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,970
You also want to add a class of clothes here in the actual tag.

23
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,050
OK which we don't usually do but in this case we do so let's save that.

24
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,110
Now Yosi they look much better and we can actually close the chips.

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:59,120
Ok they come back if we reload because obviously we're not like persisting data or anything like that.

26
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,230
But yes we can close that and close the chips up.

27
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:13,350
All right we can also use images with chips so I'll just grab one of these divs here and add the class

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,460
and then we could add an image so say image slash image one dog j peg.

29
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,800
And for this one let's do image to

30
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,020
and for this one will do image three.

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,250
So if we go ahead and save that now you see that we have our chips so we have little images.

32
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:47,300
A good reason to have this would be for avatars if you were to have people and you had their little

33
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,770
avatar there and maybe even just one on a blog post the author or whatever.

34
00:02:53,150 --> 00:03:01,920
So we can also have inputs where we can have auto completes and we can actually add chips to the input.

35
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,630
A good way.

36
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:10,910
A good reason for this would be a blog post form where you are adding these tags and maybe you had a

37
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,840
list of.

38
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,220
Or a database full of tags that you wanted to come up automatically.

39
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:25,570
So we would have to do is take a div and go ahead and give it a class of chips dash input.

40
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,830
And if I save that nothing's going to happen we're actually going to have to add some javascript's So

41
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,870
we're going to go down to where we put our Javascript.

42
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:43,640
And from here we're going to use a little Jey query and we're going to take that chips was it chips

43
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:53,510
Desch input and we want to call Daut material underscore shit like that.

44
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,550
And if I save it you'll see that it just gives us a line teks line.

45
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:04,040
And if I typed something in and hit enter it turns into a chip and we can actually get rid of them as

46
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,360
well.

47
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,140
So really cool.

48
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,170
There's actually quite a few options we can as well if we put some curly braces here so we could put

49
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,250
our placeholder

50
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,750
takes a string so we could say enter a tag and save in a C now says enter a tag.

51
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,080
We could do a secondary placeholder

52
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:42,330
that should actually be secondary uppercase P placeholder and we'll say plus tag and save.

53
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,750
And what this does is if I add a tag and enter you'll see that.

54
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:52,550
Now read here it says Plus tags so every time I enter it'll say plus tag after it.

55
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:52,920
All right.

56
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,970
We also have autocomplete options.

57
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,450
So it's a auto complete options.

58
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:12,150
And here we can put an object that takes a data object and let's say HTL Actually it should be in the

59
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,910
form of a string so aged him out and set that too.

60
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,750
Now it's a success

61
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,510
and let's say javascript.

62
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,020
All right.

63
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,680
So if I were to save that and I would start to type.

64
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,610
Each team now would just click in here.

65
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,040
So you'll see we get the dropdown if I do see we'll get we'll see SS and Javascript will come up because

66
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:50,230
they both have a C like s than just C Ss and if I click on the dropdown it'll get added as a tag.

67
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,220
All right.

68
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:58,960
And I think I think that's pretty much it as far as really useful options.

69
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,570
Now one other thing you can do is you can add an event for when you add a chip.

70
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:12,670
So let's say add inserts to uppercase will we'll add chip event.

71
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,800
So if we have our chips inport

72
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:29,820
or chip dash and what we can do dot on and then we have an event called Chip Daut add and then we put

73
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,140
a function here for when that happens.

74
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:41,880
And this would take in an event in the chip and let's do a console log.

75
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,420
All right.

76
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,310
And I'm just going to put some back ticks in here I'm going to use a template string so that I can put

77
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,140
a variable in my string.

78
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:58,650
So say you added a chip and then here will put a variable so we can use this syntax is E-6 javascript

79
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,120
syntax and we can say Chip dog tag.

80
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,900
All right so now if I add something here let's say hello.

81
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,430
Actually it's opened up our console with F 12.

82
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,300
So say hello and hit enter.

83
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,480
That didn't work.

84
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,960
Oh I forgot the dog should be classed ship in port.

85
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,390
Or is it chips.

86
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,110
Yeah I guess it's chips and put so.

87
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,050
Hello.

88
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:30,720
There we go.

89
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,950
So you added a chip.

90
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,760
Hello.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,430
We say test.

92
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:40,230
You added a chip test so if for some reason you want something to happen in your javascript when a chip

93
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,010
is added you could do that.

94
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:49,670
OK could get added to a database or you know through an API or whatever it is that you want to do.

95
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,150
All right so now we're going to take a look at pagination which is pretty easy it's just a couple of

96
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,960
classes we need to add.

97
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,680
Basically we just have a UL with a bunch of allies within a tag.

98
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,330
And the first and last one have icons.

99
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,330
OK so they have tags.

100
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:13,090
So what we'll do is add a class to the UL of pagination.

101
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,580
And this first list item here I'm going to give a class of disabled

102
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,650
and we're going to give this an icon this is going to be the one the left icon.

103
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,080
So it's going to be Chevron underscore left.

104
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:38,810
And of course we need to give it to the class of material ikons

105
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:54,890
all right and then each each list item here we're going to give a class of waves dash effect.

106
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,000
OK.

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,200
And I'm just going to copy this and each list each beginning list tag I'm going to add that class to

108
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:09,970
OK.

109
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:17,600
And then for this icon here we're going to give it a class of material icons

110
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,810
and we're going to make this one a chevron underscore.

111
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,870
Right.

112
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,410
So let's save that.

113
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,290
So there's our pagination now.

114
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,780
You'll have an active page number that you were on so let's say we want to to be the active.

115
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:40,760
What we would do is just add the class of active and save.

116
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,660
And now I can see that that's active.

117
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,690
And the waves classify you see if I click it will give it that effect.

118
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,230
All right so it's as easy as that to create pagination in your UI.

119
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:57,410
Obviously you know with your back and programming or whatever it is you're doing you'll have to add

120
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,430
that logic but this gives you the UI.

121
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,410
All right guys.

122
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,870
That's it.

123
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,850
And the next video we're going to take a look at prae Lowder's.
