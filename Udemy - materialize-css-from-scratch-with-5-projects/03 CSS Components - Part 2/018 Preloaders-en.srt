1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,250
All right guys now we're going to take a look at prae Lowder's which are like animated spinners and

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,370
you can see I have one here already.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,990
The reason that I have this here and it's already it's already has all its classes because there's quite

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,550
a few classes that you need for it to have one of these spinners and they didn't want to just have you

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,300
watch me type them all and they're pretty repetitive.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,150
We have the circle circle three times but this is a standard preload or and I'm going to get to this

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,480
I want to show you how to change colors how to change sizes and so on.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,910
But before we do that I just want to look at the progress bars.

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,700
OK so we have determinant progress bars and indeterminant So we're going to start with the determinant.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,420
So this div here we're going to give a class of progress.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,020
We basically just have a nested div and then the second one we're going to give a class of determinant

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,430
and then we also want to give this a style attribute because we need to set a with K.

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,630
So basically how full Do we want this to be let's say 70 percent.

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,770
So that gives us a 70 percent full progress bar.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,310
If we were to do 50 percent that will be half full.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,600
OK now the indeterminant if we were to give this a class of progress just like the one above.

17
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,320
Notice that these are in six column divs are six column divs inside of a row.

18
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,980
And then we'll give this a class of indeterminant

19
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,290
and save.

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:37,140
So this is kind of like a horizontal preload or we don't need a lot with or anything like that because

21
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,830
it's not actually a progress bar it's more like a preload or type pre-loading that looks like a progress

22
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,170
bar.

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,780
All right so now let's move on to the actual spinner preload.

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,170
So like I said this is the bare bones that you need to create this.

25
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,920
You even need the active class if I get rid of that.

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,100
You'll see that goes away.

27
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,620
So make sure you have that.

28
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,590
Now this says small red so what I'm going to do is to change the size to small I'm going to have the

29
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,390
class small save that and you'll see it shrinks.

30
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:18,720
And if I want this to be read then I'm going to give this a class or add to the class of spinner Lehre

31
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:25,610
and we're going to say spinner dash red dash only and save.

32
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,760
And now you see it's a red spinner.

33
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,250
OK so what I'm going to do now is just copy the whole preload or wrapper to the ending div here and

34
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,590
go to the next one and paste that in.

35
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,300
And we're going to change.

36
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:47,210
This is standard blue so I'll get rid of the small class and change this to spinner blue only and save.

37
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,380
And now it's just the medium size or the standard size blue.

38
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:59,490
OK if we want a big yellow one we can go ahead and paste this in and change this to big and then change

39
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,700
this to spin or yellow.

40
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:08,310
So these are the only classes you really need to change if you want to change the look of the spinners.

41
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:08,670
All right.

42
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,890
Now we can also do a spinner with flashing colors and this has quite a bit of markup.

43
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:22,860
What I'm going to do is copy this last one we did the big yellow and paste this in here.

44
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,190
All right.

45
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:30,880
Now the the idea is to have one pre-Lie one wrapper and then to have a bunch of spinner Lehre class

46
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,210
divs inside.

47
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,260
So I'm just going to spaces out a little.

48
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,750
So this is the first one.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,280
And let's say we want the first color to be let's say green.

50
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,640
So we would change just not to spin or green only but to just spinner green.

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:48,840
All right.

52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,490
And then we would take this OK.

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,850
Not the preload.

54
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,100
But everything in it.

55
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:01,490
And then add that down here and we'll change this one to let's say blue.

56
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,810
So we want the second color to be blue.

57
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,480
And then we'll go ahead and paste in another one and we'll change this one to red.

58
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:09,780
All right.

59
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,970
And then going to save this.

60
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,970
And now we have a spinner that's going to change colors.

61
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,100
OK so it's going to fade from green to blue to red.

62
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,640
OK and I know that's a lot of markup just for that one spinner but you need that if you want it to flash

63
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,550
different colors.

64
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,490
All right so that's it.

65
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,180
Not too much to this.

66
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,580
Pretty simple.

67
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,510
This is actually going to be the last video on CSSA components.

68
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,840
So the next video will start to get into javascript's OK or the next section.

69
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,660
And we're going to look at the Carousel.
