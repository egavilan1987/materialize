1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,820
All right so now we're going to start to get into the javascript widgets or javascript components of

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,990
material ICSA us and we're going to start off with the carousel so this is file for underscore one carousel

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,870
and you see these panels here.

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,110
This is actually for the content slider down here which we're going to get to later.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,830
But first we're going to deal with just a straight image slider or I should say Carrousel.

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,380
So let's give this div a class of Carrousel.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:36,160
OK whenever we want to use a carousel we add that class and then these tags here need a class of carrousel

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,630
dash item.

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,350
All right.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,160
Now this will work without having a Tref but it's good practice to put something here.

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,480
I'm going to put a hash one exclamation just to give it kind of an identifier and also to give it a

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,340
pointer when you hover over it.

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,420
And then for the image we'll just do image slash image one dot j peg.

14
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,750
All right so that's basically it for a carousel.

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,000
I am.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,920
So what I'm going to do is copy this a tag and let's just copy it let's just paste this.

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:15,300
And so that's one two three four more so one two three four and we're going to change the image numbers

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,180
here.

19
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,340
OK.

20
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:25,030
And let's change the identifiers of the length so it will say 2

21
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,010
3

22
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,310
4

23
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,780
and 5.

24
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:39,210
Right.

25
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,980
Now if I say we don't see anything because just like with most of the JavaScript widgets it needs to

26
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,130
be initialized in Jay Querrey or in Javascript.

27
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,980
So let's go down to the bottom here.

28
00:01:50,290 --> 00:02:00,210
And all we have to do is throw in our query and say the carousel class is probably spell it right.

29
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,650
And then we just need to call Daut carrousel like that and save.

30
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,480
And there we go.

31
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:13,670
So now we have a nice carousel and if we click on one of these images it'll go over we can go backwards.

32
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,780
It's also touch enabled for mobile devices.

33
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,630
So that's one type of carrousel we also have a full with our Slider.

34
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,260
It's also called.

35
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:29,290
So I'm going to do is copy this whole thing we just did and then I'm going to comment it out OK and

36
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,240
then for the full width I'm going to just replace what we have here.

37
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:44,050
And then we're just going to add one class in addition to carrousel called carrousel dash slider and

38
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,320
save right.

39
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,290
Now if we just do this you can see it gives us one image at a time and I can bring it over.

40
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,320
But it still has that effect where it's kind of getting smaller and then the other one comes in.

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:04,090
This the switch effect is the same if we want to have just a straight slider what we can do is it's

42
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,710
actually a comment that out and

43
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:19,500
we'll say gee query let's say dark carousel dash slider.

44
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,520
And again we're going to do a carousel.

45
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:29,640
But we're going to pass an option of full with and set that to true.

46
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,140
All right so let's save that now it looks the same to begin with but if I slide it notice that it doesn't

47
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,200
have that effect it's just a straight slider just goes from image to image without one getting smaller

48
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,160
and having that that switch effect.

49
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,400
And you can also go backwards.

50
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:46,830
OK.

51
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,380
But it's up to you if you wanted that the other way that's fine as well.

52
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,190
All right so those are the basic image sliders or carousels knowledge.

53
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,280
Look at the content slider.

54
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,410
So instead of just having images we can actually have content.

55
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,330
So what I want to do is comment this so

56
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,700
and let's let's start to add some stuff here.

57
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,930
There's quite a few classes we need to add so just like above we need the carousel class.

58
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,240
We also want the carousel slider

59
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,530
and we also want I'm going to do centers well which will center everything.

60
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,520
And then it's going to have another attribute called Data dash indicators

61
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,510
and we want to set that to true.

62
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:49,070
All right the indicators are basically the little dots that show which slide you're on.

63
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:56,280
And I think we can actually use these with with the other ones actually hold on let me try this for

64
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,060
a second.

65
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:08,320
If we put this in here and save up so we can do that with the images as well see the little dots here.

66
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,350
I should mentioned that.

67
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,520
All right.

68
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,790
So I'm going to comment that back go and we're going to have the data indicators on the content slider

69
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,800
as well.

70
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,740
And then for this div here.

71
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,550
Notice that the div has the Tref OK that's not a mistake it's supposed to we're supposed to do that

72
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,060
and we're going to give it a hash one exclamation.

73
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,590
All right we're also going to give it a couple classes.

74
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:43,920
So we're going to give it a class of carrousel item just like above and let's say we want the background

75
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,480
to be read and then I want white text.

76
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,220
OK.

77
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:57,030
And then for the H-2 we're going to leave that no class is needed for this.

78
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:07,090
This div right here we're going to give this a class of carrousel dash fixed dash.

79
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,070
Item.

80
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:08,820
OK.

81
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,830
We also want to center it because it's going to fix it.

82
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,490
It's going to basically just do just that.

83
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,770
It's going to position it in a fixed position and then we're going to have a button or it's actually

84
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,110
a length that I'm going to format as a button by giving it a classic beat and then I'm also going to

85
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,420
make it the color black.

86
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,730
OK so that is a panel.

87
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,150
Each each slide is called a panel.

88
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:40,440
So what I'm going to do is copy this whole div right here and then we have what three more so go ahead

89
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,780
and replace all these.

90
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,340
That one ends there.

91
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,730
So say one two three more and I'll save it in a minute.

92
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,970
Let's change up some stuff so this will be two.

93
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,340
This will be three and four.

94
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,620
And then let's change up the colors a little bit.

95
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:10,070
So the second one let's make it instead of red we'll make it Amber.

96
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,720
And the third one let's make green.

97
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,620
And then the fourth one will make blue.

98
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,940
All right let's save that and then we go.

99
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:29,570
So we have our heading we have our paragraph in our button our indicators and we can we can slide it

100
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:37,700
and we can put any type of content here we want and then fix the carousel fixed item is what pushes

101
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,680
this button down here.

102
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:47,930
If we didn't have this class let's save that let's go to the last one you'll see that it's just right

103
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,700
under the paragraph.

104
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,000
But if you want it down there you can add that fixed item class.

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,580
That's what that does.

106
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,100
All right guys.

107
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,400
Those are the different types of carousels that we can have with materialize in the next video we're

108
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,710
going to go ahead and look at the collapsible widget.
