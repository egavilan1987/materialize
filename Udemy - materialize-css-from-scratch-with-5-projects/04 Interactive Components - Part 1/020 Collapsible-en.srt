1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,800
All right guys who are in this video we're going to look at the collapsible widget which is basically

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,900
like an accordion menu.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,620
So what we're going to do is go to for a collapsable daughter H.T. amount.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,890
And you see we have a UL here and each UL has an ally with two divs.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:24,240
The first div has the header or the heading and then the second one has the text or the body which is

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,400
in a span.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,140
We also have an icon next to the heading.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,480
So first thing we're going to do is give this UL a class of collapsable

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:45,960
and we're going to give it a another attribute called Data dash collapsable and we want to let it know

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,470
that this is going to be an accordion type or an accordion collapsable I should probably spell that

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,040
right though.

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,660
All right.

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,110
And then each list item it doesn't need a class.

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,820
What we do need a class on that is.

15
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,700
So this does will have a class of collapsable however.

16
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,270
Westons spell that right.

17
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:19,440
So collapsable Hetter it's hard to talk and type and then let's see for an icon of course we need our

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,250
class of material Icahn's doesn't matter what icon we're using we need that.

19
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:32,160
And then inside here we're going to give it to the group underscore work icon and then for this div

20
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,460
the second div here it's going to have a class of collapsable body.

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,430
OK so we have collapsible Hetter and collapsible body.

22
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:51,930
So what I'm going to do is just copy this list item and let's see if we can ignore this pre-select for

23
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,650
now.

24
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,980
But let's go ahead and just replace both of these list items so one and two.

25
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,910
And then we're going to change this to second.

26
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,710
I will say this is the second area.

27
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,110
And then this will be third.

28
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,900
Let's say this is the third area.

29
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:21,420
And let's also change the icon so the second one will be the help icon and then the third one will be

30
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,720
the info icon.

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,290
All right so let's save that.

32
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,740
And there we go.

33
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,570
And if I click on one of these headings you'll see that the body will show.

34
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,930
And it's only going to show one at a time.

35
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:39,000
If I if I were looking at the third body and I could the first third is going to go away.

36
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:39,350
OK.

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,960
So that's the accordion type.

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,420
And then if we want to pre-select something I noticed when I enter the page they're all closed if I

39
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:53,320
want one to be open then we could go ahead and do that by adding an active class to the header.

40
00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:00,660
So let's say we want the second one and that's why I had that pre-select comment there so let's save

41
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,020
and now you see the second one is automatically open when we enter the page.

42
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,800
So that's the accordion we also have the expandable type which instead of doing it from scratch I'm

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:19,990
just going to copy this whole UL here and just replace this one and then all we're going to do is change

44
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,620
the data collapsable attribute to expand the expandable

45
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,550
and we'll go ahead and save that.

46
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,640
Now the difference is even though I have the second one open if I could.

47
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:40,230
The first the second one stays open so we can have multiple groups are multiple content areas open at

48
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,050
the same time where with the accordion it can only be one at a time that's the main difference between

49
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,880
adding accordion or expandable.

50
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,550
All right.

51
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,170
So that's pretty much all there is to it.

52
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:01,770
We can also add in events so that when it's open when a collapsible item is open we can do something

53
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:09,390
or when it's closed so if we go down to the javascript and we go ahead and put in our collapsible class

54
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,000
and we call Daut

55
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:32,060
collapsable and then we can pass and here and object and we can do on the open and set that to a function.

56
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,450
So function and let's just pass and here we'll say alerts

57
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,790
open.

58
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:51,280
So save that and Ill do it right away because we have one that's pre-selected or two that are pre-selected.

59
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,500
They both have the collapsible class so both will be affected.

60
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,550
But if I open another one it will say open.

61
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,320
It'll give the alert right before it opens.

62
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:13,690
We can do the same thing one close if I were to grab this and we could do on close and will alert close.

63
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,360
All right so save we get open.

64
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,180
Open.

65
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,400
And if I close the second one now we get close.

66
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,610
All right so we can have something happen in javascript when we open and close these accordion items.

67
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,600
OK so that's it for collapsable.

68
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,330
And the next video we're going to look at feature discovery.
