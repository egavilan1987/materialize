1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:06,240
All right guys so we're going to take a look at the feature of discovery widget I guess we could call

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,940
it in materialize which is really cool.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,580
So basically if we were to click this button here we get this really cool.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,380
I don't know what to call this really it's just like a pop up with syntax with the heading and paragraph

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,970
from that pulsating effect so we can open and close it.

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,240
But I have an issue with this documentation because this actually doesn't give us everything we need

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,040
to actually create this.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,530
If you were to take this and put it in your age Tim Allen add this J query it doesn't work.

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,630
So I'm going to show you how to actually do it.

10
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:46,310
So in the four underscore or three feature discovery age I'll file it should look like this.

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,910
Basically we're going to have our open and close buttons and then we're going to have the mock up for

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,330
the feature discovery.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,460
So these two buttons are actually links but they're going to be formatted as buttons.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,580
Let's give them the class of waves effect.

15
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,180
You don't want cap locks locks whatever caps lock.

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,060
So waves effect.

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,210
And then also we want waves dash light and DTN.

18
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,620
All right.

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,800
We want the same classes for

20
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,980
this one here.

21
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,290
Class.

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,120
All right.

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:40,700
So we're also going to add in on click event here and we're just going to do it this way where we say

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,760
on click and we want to take the top target class

25
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,600
and we want to call DOT tap target.

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,430
I like that and then we want to call open.

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,960
All right.

28
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:11,270
And then we're going to actually just copy that on click and put that on this one as well on this tag

29
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,800
except we're going to change this to close.

30
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,340
All right.

31
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,930
And that will actually activate the feature discovery.

32
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,330
Let's save that.

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,040
It's not going to do anything yet because we haven't added the markup for the feature discovery for

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,790
the buttons and so on.

35
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,360
Or the the whatever that is the floating action button.

36
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:40,880
So let's go to Steve here and let's give it a class of fixed action button nothing we haven't seen before.

37
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:48,900
And for the tag we're going to give us an idea of menu and then we're going to give this a class of

38
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,770
beat and beat and floating to make it the circular button and we want it to be large and we want it

39
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,720
to be the color cyan.

40
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,410
OK.

41
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:06,200
And then for the icon let's say material icons we're going to give it the menu.

42
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,660
The menu icon.

43
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:09,130
OK.

44
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,770
So if I save that we have our little button here.

45
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,170
Let's see it should be down here and the reason it's on is because I put the word button here that should

46
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,400
be beat.

47
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,040
OK.

48
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,230
Now that moves it down.

49
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:30,330
Now this div here we're going to give this a class and this is something that's not in that documentation

50
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,020
page.

51
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:40,470
We're going to give us a class of top targets wrapper and then this does we're going to give a class

52
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,690
of tap dash target.

53
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:51,700
We're also going to give a color class of Suyin and then we need to give it a attribute of data activates.

54
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,790
OK so we're going to say data activates menu which should match the ID here.

55
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:12,240
And then this div underneath we're going to give this a class of tap target content and let's also give

56
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,750
it a class of white text to make sure the text is white.

57
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,650
I'm also going to give this paragraph a class of white text

58
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,880
not positive that that's needed.

59
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,390
But I'm just going to put it anyways.

60
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,060
OK.

61
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:35,720
And then we need another button another folding button down here so this does the one that wraps the

62
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:50,550
tag we're going to give a class of tap Dasch target Dasch wave and then the tag will give that a class

63
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,070
of beads and PTEN floating.

64
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:03,860
And also to make it large large and let's make it sign.

65
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,320
And we also want to give it a class of tap target origin.

66
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,310
OK and I'll show you why we have two of these floating buttons here in a minute.

67
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:23,360
But let's also give this I tag a class of material icons and the menu icon in that should do it.

68
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,930
So let's save that.

69
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,990
And now if I click this button I so open now open is actually going to toggle it.

70
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,020
The Clozaril only close.

71
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,590
OK if I click this it doesn't do anything unless it's already opened then it will close it.

72
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,940
OK so the open will actually toggle close we'll just close it.

73
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,120
Now you notice that we have two of these these floating buttons.

74
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,910
One is in this state.

75
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:58,990
The other is in this state so if I were to change this icon to see the clothes icon and save you'll

76
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:05,440
see that we have the menu icon but once I open the feature discovery it changes to close and I can actually

77
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,730
click that and close it.

78
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:13,410
So if you wanted to keep it like that you could if you wanted to change the color like say red.

79
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,290
So when we open it now it turns red.

80
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:24,110
OK so you can change the the open state of the button if you want or you can just keep it the same and

81
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,650
it's completely up to you.

82
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:32,110
But this is the correct markup that actually works and they don't have this in the documentation.

83
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:39,700
All right so in the next video we're going to take a look at the TOSed component which is kind of like

84
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,950
a kind of like an alert box that pops up and then it fades nicely.

85
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,810
We're also going to look at tool tips and these are both different forms of dialogue's.

86
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,850
All right so that's what we'll get into next guys.
