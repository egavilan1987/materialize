1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,250
All right guys in this video we're going to look at dialogues so we have toasts and tool tips toasts

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,060
are basically kind of like alerts that pop up and dismiss.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,510
And then a tool tip is if we hover over it we'll get a little tool tip over and we can position them

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,710
as well.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,930
Now for the toast we're going to add a little bit of Javascript so you can see here we just have a bunch

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,740
of buttons we have show.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,580
We have rounded toast and toast with callbacks.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,640
We're going to start with just the show toast.

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,450
Now we could put this inside of an on click if we wanted to.

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,480
But I'm going to do it the better way which would be to give this some kind of ID.

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,520
So it's a we call it toast one.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,530
And then we'll go down to the javascript and we could use vanilla javascript here but we've been using

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,450
Jey queries so we might as we'll just use that.

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:58,560
So we'll say TOSed one and we'll say dog click OK.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,380
So when that's clicked we're going to run a function

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,560
and inside this function we're going to say materialize

17
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,230
materialized on toast.

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,750
And inside here will say I am toast.

19
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,730
So let's save that and let's click that first button and we get this I am toast.

20
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:31,130
Now by default I think it'll just stay there forever until we actually go down and click it or click

21
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,460
we can kind of drag it away but we can add a duration so let's put a comma here and add a second parameter

22
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,890
of 3000 and save and then click it again and it should go away in three seconds.

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,320
OK so this is in milliseconds so 3000 milliseconds is three seconds.

24
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:57,930
So it's as simple as that to show one of these things for the rounded what we can do here is let's give

25
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,750
this an ID of toast to.

26
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,490
While we're at it we'll give this one an idea of toast three.

27
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,760
And then we'll go down here and

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,180
let's just copy this.

29
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,160
So I'll say toast two.

30
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:27,420
And then all we have to do to make this round rounded is add in a third parameter and say rounded.

31
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:35,440
So save or click on that and we get the rounded toast and it should go away in three in three seconds.

32
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,090
All right.

33
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,780
So let me just put some comments here for you guys so just say

34
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,850
we're on toast

35
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:56,680
rounded toast and then we can also do a toast callback.

36
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,400
Meaning that if we wanted something to happen once just once a toast is dismissed and goes away we can

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,970
do that.

38
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,050
So I'm going to copy this and we'll change it to toast three.

39
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:16,170
That's the third button and we're just going to add in another parameter which will be a function and

40
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:23,480
we can do whatever we want here let's just say a word and we'll say toast.

41
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,610
Dismissed.

42
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,300
OK now you can keep this rounded.

43
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,970
If you didn't want it to be rounded you could just pass in an empty string like that for the third parameter.

44
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,590
So let's save that and let's click the last one here and then once it goes away.

45
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,170
We get an alert.

46
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,630
All right.

47
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,690
And obviously you can do whatever you want inside of this function.

48
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,170
But if you wanted something to happen you could do that.

49
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:57,890
Now in addition to button clicks we can actually ignites the TOSed from javascript's So it's.

50
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,410
Or we'll just say create

51
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:12,750
toast by just simply saying actually we'll describe this right here and paste it in and save it now

52
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,590
when the page enters it'll actually run.

53
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,860
So we can do that we can also dismiss them all if we want.

54
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,950
So if I were to click this multiple times we'll get multiple toasts but if I wanted to get rid of them

55
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,570
I would say remove all toes.

56
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:41,290
And what I want to do is I'm going to use the set time out javascript function and that will allow me

57
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:49,390
to do something after a certain amount of time so it takes in a function and then it takes a second

58
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,280
parameter of the amount of time to wait.

59
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,480
So I'm going to say two seconds or two thousand milliseconds and then in here I'm going to say materialize

60
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:05,400
Daut toast Daut remove all.

61
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:12,220
OK so what will happen is in two seconds after the page loads it'll remove any toes that are visible.

62
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,630
So let's save it.

63
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:19,690
Let's click this a bunch of times and in two seconds they'll disappear OK I'll reload cooking a bunch

64
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,070
of times two seconds.

65
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,120
They all go away.

66
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,560
OK so this will remove all.

67
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,030
OK.

68
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:33,190
And again you're not restricted to Jay Querrey for instance we could do if we comment this so.

69
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:41,440
So if I comment that out let's also comment the one out that runs automatically if I could the first

70
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,390
but nothing's happening.

71
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:55,230
But if I wanted to do it say documents daunts get element by id grab toast one and we could say Daut

72
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:05,770
add event listener and we could say on a click than we want to call actual do.

73
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,750
Well we'll just do a function like this.

74
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,470
I'm not going to get to and start using aero functions and stuff even though I know a lot of you guys

75
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,680
do know that stuff.

76
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,410
This is a materialized course.

77
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,710
It's not a javascript course if you are interested in aero functions.

78
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:28,150
6 in advanced javascript I would suggest my modern javascript from the beginning course but what we're

79
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,130
going to do here is just this line.

80
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:39,140
OK so this should do the same thing as this just without j queries so if we save and I click it and

81
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,210
nothing happens let's see why is that.

82
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,930
That's because I shouldn't have a hash here because it's get element by d it knows it's an idea without

83
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,130
that hash.

84
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,390
So there we go Snel that works.

85
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,280
All right.

86
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,690
So that's going to be it for the toasts.

87
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:01,640
Now let's move on to tool tips and there's not really anything we need to do in the javascript for tool

88
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,060
tips.

89
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,810
Everything is done through custom attributes.

90
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:13,280
OK so we have a bottom tool tip what we need to do is add a class in addition to button tool tips like

91
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,970
that.

92
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:21,980
And then we add a data position attribute which in this case we want to be bottom.

93
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,140
So if I save that and I click.

94
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,580
Actually we need some content.

95
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,770
So that's going to go in an attribute called Data Dasch tool tip

96
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,950
and this will be the content.

97
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:48,390
So just say I am a tool tip and now if I click that we get I'm a tool tip and when I hover away it goes

98
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,150
away.

99
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,720
All right now if we want it displayed in a different position where I could do is just going to copy

100
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:04,140
this whole a tag here and paste it here and then we'll just change the position to top we'll do the

101
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:09,780
same thing here will change the position to right.

102
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,150
And then here will change the position to the left.

103
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,150
All right so it's going to work the same way except there are going to be in different positions so

104
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,640
that's the right that's the left.

105
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:29,220
And then lastly we can add a delay if we want so if we hover over any of these they pretty much just

106
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:38,060
show up right away if we wanted to delay we could add a data delay attribute and set that to milliseconds

107
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,740
we'll say 2000 so two seconds.

108
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:46,990
So the first one if I hover over it it takes two seconds for the tool tip to show.

109
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:52,640
OK and just for that one these ones will show up fine but this one will wait two seconds.

110
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:52,950
All right.

111
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:59,940
So that's it for tose intuitive dialogs and the next video will look at the material box widget as well

112
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,080
as the slider.
