1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,860
Hey guys in this video we're going to take a look at the material box which is kind of like a light

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,510
box.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:13,560
And also the slider now the slider is similar to the carousel slider version but it's a little different

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,660
song and show you how to do that.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,070
We're going to go to four underscore five material box slider door each tiem now and go to where it

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,660
says start here.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,010
All right.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,670
So we basically just have a row with two six column divs.

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,970
So I'm going to put one material box here and then one on this side one will have a caption and one

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,520
won't.

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,490
So basically we just have an image tag here and we're going to add our image source which will be IMJ

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,780
slash image one dot J Pag.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:53,340
And then we're also going to give this a class of material boxed and then we're going to give it a with

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,150
of 100 percent OK and that's it.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,210
Let's save it.

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,300
So there's our image.

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:05,610
If I go and I hover over it you'll see automatically it fades out and it gives us this magnifying glass

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,570
icon.

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,390
If I click it and then it brings the image into focus so it's gives us a nice light box effect with

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,440
almost no work at all just a class and a with.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:16,870
All right.

22
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:24,330
Now we want to have a caption what we could do is let's just copy this and replace this image here we'll

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,040
put it to image too.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,960
And we still want the material box class and the with but all we have to do is add a data caption attribute

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:42,780
and we'll say this is my awesome photo and save.

26
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,950
And same thing now if I click it you'll see down here we get a little caption.

27
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,610
All right so pretty cool pretty easy.

28
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,810
Next we're going to take a look at the slider.

29
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,390
So for the slider we're going to give this div that wraps around this well.

30
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:06,610
A class of slider and then the UL will get a class of slides.

31
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,750
OK.

32
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:13,670
And then the Allies don't have to have any special class we're going to put our image in here.

33
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:20,580
I mean these image three since we used one into the material box and then the div that goes around the

34
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:29,130
H3 in the h 5 here we're going to go ahead and give that a class of caption

35
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:47,280
and let's see for the H5 any of that a class of light and let's do Gray dash text and let's say teks

36
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,000
dash liten 3 so just changing up the color a bit making it a little lighter.

37
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,340
All right.

38
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,570
And then more what I'll do is copy this whole div here.

39
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:05,310
All right so the caption div and I'll replace this paste.

40
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:15,170
Then let's throw our image in here we'll do image for and then let's go down here we'll replace this

41
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:29,000
div again and do image image 5. Jay peg is going to change these captions because they don't make sense.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,410
We're going to do the center one there.

43
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:44,840
This one will be the left will say left a line caption and this will be the right line caption.

44
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,500
All right.

45
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,990
So if I save that we're just going to see a box here and that's because we haven't initialized it so

46
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:58,310
we're you to go down to the javascript and we're just going to use a little bit of query here and say

47
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,360
the class of slider.

48
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,980
And then we want to call Daut slider.

49
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,270
OK.

50
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,500
And now you can see we have our image.

51
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,370
We also get these little dots down here we have our caption.

52
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,350
Now the text is not aligned yet.

53
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,120
I haven't added the class for that.

54
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:24,680
They're all in the same place but let's say for the first image which is actually image 3.

55
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,180
Let's say we want to center that.

56
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:38,480
So what we would do is add in to where we have the caption class we would say Center dash line.

57
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:52,080
And let's see this one here we'll put in a class of left a line and then we have right a line.

58
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,070
We'll save that.

59
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:59,650
Now that one center you can't really see it I guess we could we should probably make this text darker.

60
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,210
So let's do class.

61
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:12,770
Actually we want the first one to class equal this will slave black and we'll do black for this one

62
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,370
as well.

63
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,460
I'm sorry should be black text.

64
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,770
Otherwise it's going to do the background.

65
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,320
There you go.

66
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,850
So that's centered.

67
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,670
Next one comes in from the left.

68
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,560
Next one comes in from the right.

69
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:32,900
OK.

70
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,830
So that's a slider.

71
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:41,280
Now we can add options as well so if we go down to where we have our slider and we pass in an object

72
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,120
we can say indicators.

73
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,620
So if we wanted to not show the indicators which are those dots we'll save that nicely those are gone.

74
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,380
But I'm going to keep that to true.

75
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,430
We can also change the height.

76
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,160
So I think the default is 400.

77
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:06,020
But if we wanted to do it say 600 and save you'll see that now it's bigger.

78
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,850
We're going to keep it at 400.

79
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,670
We can also change the transition.

80
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:17,950
The transition speed which is I think 500 by default will set it to two thousand.

81
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,540
So now it takes a lot longer to go from one image to the other.

82
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,480
You know see where it changes

83
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,030
takes a lot longer to kind of fade in.

84
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,740
But the default I believe is 500.

85
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:39,970
And then we can also change the interval for which the image shows I believe the default is 6 seconds.

86
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,480
Let's change it to.

87
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:49,720
So I'll save it should stay for two seconds switch to seconds switch and so on but we'll set it to six

88
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,890
which is the default.

89
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,130
So you have a couple of different options that you can use with the slider.

90
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,330
So some pretty cool effects nice components but that's it.

91
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,170
In the next video we're going to take a look at modals.
