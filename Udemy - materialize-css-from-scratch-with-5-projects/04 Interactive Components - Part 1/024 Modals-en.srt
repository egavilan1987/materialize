1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,760
All right it's you know we're going to take a look at modals.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,620
So we've havock if you have experience with bootstrap then you know what imortal is basically where

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,120
we have a button we click and we have this nice little pop up with some content.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,690
Now we can see the modal content right away I have that already here.

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:26,040
Just by taking the div right here and adding the class of modal and saving that will actually make the

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,590
content disappear.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,760
OK and we can do the same thing for this down here.

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:37,020
So this div will give a class of modal and save.

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,480
That's going to go away.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,860
And let's see did I have another one.

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,420
Bottom sheet motile.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,910
So this right here also give a class of motile and it just sets it to hide by default.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,270
All right.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,480
Now we're going to do is go back up to the first one and we're going to work on the trigger.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,310
OK so every modal needs to have some kind of trigger which is usually a button or a link.

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,850
So we're going to add of class here.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,270
Let's make it look good.

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:13,530
Little push button put waves effect and waves dash lights and then we also need to put the class of

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,760
modal dash trigger.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,790
OK.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,670
In addition to that we need an H raft which is going to go to an ID.

22
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,430
So it's going to be a hash and then I'm going to call it modal one.

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:25,940
OK.

24
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,940
So that is going to look for a motile with the idea of modal one.

25
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:35,610
So we're going to go down here and give this an ID of modal one.

26
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,540
And that's how it knows to to use that modal.

27
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:45,090
OK and then there's just a couple of things you need to add here so this div should have a class of

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:59,450
modal dash content and this div right here should have a class of modal dash for her.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,110
All right.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,620
And then this.

31
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,490
OK right here I'm going to make this into a button.

32
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:12,860
So it's a actually it's going to be a modal action buttons so it will take a class of modal action sort

33
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,950
of kind of be built into the modal.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,840
I'm also going to give it a class of modal close so that it closes when we click it.

35
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:30,650
Let's do a Wavves effect and let's do waves green and let's do DTN flat.

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,100
All right.

37
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,790
So let's see what that looks like.

38
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,680
OK so we have our button if I click it.

39
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,000
Hey it's not working because we actually have to initialize the motile.

40
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,090
So we're going to go down to the javascript

41
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:59,750
and we're going to put in our J query for the modal class and we're going to say Daut modal cadence

42
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,880
that should be enough.

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,330
There we go.

44
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:07,920
So now we have our modal never OK button if I click that that's going to close it automatically.

45
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,800
Now we have some options we can put in here.

46
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:20,680
So one is dismissable hand and that's true by default I believe because if I click and I click outside

47
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,360
it closes.

48
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,210
But if we don't want that we can set it to false.

49
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,470
That way if we click and I click outside it does not close.

50
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,740
I have to actually click OK.

51
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,600
All right but true is the default and that's what I'm going to leave it at.

52
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,780
Another thing we can do is change the speed at which it opens and closes so Indurain will be open.

53
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,080
So let's say two thousand and that should open pretty slow.

54
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,610
So you see it comes in it takes two seconds.

55
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,810
The default I think is 300.

56
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,930
And that's really quick.

57
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,390
All right.

58
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,890
And if we want the out duration we can do that as well.

59
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,700
So we'll say out duration 2000 just to test it out comes in quick.

60
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,370
Dismiss it and it goes out slow.

61
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,880
The default for that I think is 200.

62
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,500
We can also add a call back for one when it opens.

63
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:26,620
So if we say ready we can set that to a function and that function can take in the motile and trigger

64
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:38,800
and then inside here let's just say console door log and we'll just say motile opened and then let's

65
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,220
also see what we get for modal and for a trigger.

66
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,250
All right.

67
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,820
So we'll save that we'll open up our consul with F 12.

68
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,660
Make sure you're on the console and we'll click and you can see if we get motile opened and this is

69
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,630
what it gives us for the motile.

70
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:02,860
So basically gives us the div with the ID and all the attributes and stuff and then this would be the

71
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,400
trigger.

72
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,700
So this gives us the actual button that triggered it.

73
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,720
All right so if you wanted to do something with that you could.

74
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:20,320
So let's now go back up here and see.

75
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,900
So that's just a regular motile.

76
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,190
Now let's look at the fixed footer model.

77
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,410
So I'm going to close this up and let's add to the trigger here.

78
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:47,260
So I'll say class equals waves of fact waves slides between and we eat our motile trigger.

79
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,740
OK.

80
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:55,490
It also needs to know which motile to call so that's in the treffen it's going to be the idea of motile

81
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,580
too.

82
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:07,070
All right so we're going to go down to this div and let's add the ID of modal to and then we're going

83
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:15,410
to add to this class here modal dash fixed dash flooder.

84
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:15,970
OK.

85
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:21,270
And then this div will get the content the modal content.

86
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,280
OK.

87
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,510
And then let's go down to the bottom.

88
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:33,890
After all these paragraphs and go to this div and just like above we're going to give this a mobile

89
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:47,360
for and then for the button here say Tref equals a hash exclamation and then we're going to give this

90
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:58,890
class of modal Dasch action also modal close so that it closes say waves affect

91
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,090
waves.

92
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,900
Green and Button flat.

93
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,100
All right so let's save that and see what this does so if we click that we get our fix for motile what

94
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,920
this means is that the footer here that has the button is going to stay fixed and even if the content

95
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:25,860
stretches outside it's just going to give us a scroll bar rather than making it a large motile.

96
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,500
OK.

97
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:33,140
So this is good if you want to have like a like a poster or something maybe you want a whole blog post

98
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,460
inside the motile.

99
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,660
So that's what you would use that for.

100
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,070
Now we also have something called the ball bottom sheet motile.

101
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,700
So let's go ahead and add our trigger stuff here.

102
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,600
I'll actually just copy and see.

103
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:58,350
Scrap this whole a tag here and copy it and I'll paste it here.

104
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:05,560
Except we want to change the ID to model 3 and then give this an idea of model 3

105
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:18,500
and let's also give this class in addition to motile we want to add bottom Dasch sheet.

106
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,850
OK and then for the footer we will basically want to do kind of the same thing we did here so when the

107
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:31,710
copy this whole modal for Dev and just paste that here and then we can save that let's see what that

108
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,750
does.

109
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,880
So what that does is gives us a modal but not middle of the page it puts it at the bottom.

110
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,760
OK so it's a bottom sheet motile.

111
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,070
All right.

112
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:49,030
So you have some different options as far as how this displays so that's going to be it guys in the

113
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,800
next section we're going to I start to look at some other javascript's stuff some components we're going

114
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,250
to look at parallax and we'll move on to the side Nav. and some other cool stuff as well.

115
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,160
So I will see you in the next section.
