IT guys in this video we're going to take a look at a parallax example and Aperol XS is a cool effect

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,720
a scrolling effect with images where you can actually scroll and see different parts of the image.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,300
It's just it's a really nice effect and we may use this in a project but this is going to be it's actually

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,490
pretty simple to implement what we're going to do is take this top div here and see if we have this

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,570
div it ends here and then we have another div that goes around all the content.

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,980
And then again another div around the image.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,560
OK so we're going to have two images with some content in the middle.

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,130
So this div here we're going to give a class of parallax container

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:54,140
so that materialize knows this is going to be a parallax effect and we'll give this div a class of just

10
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,270
power locks and then we'll have an image that we want to use.

11
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:11,630
I'm going to use image one J bag and this right here is going to be it's going to have a class of section

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,130
that's what we want to put around our content.

13
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,400
And then I'm also going to give it a class of white.

14
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:26,170
Make sure the backgrounds white and then let's give this a class of row and container.

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,970
Which the container I don't think we really need because we actually have this inside a container already

16
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,680
but that's fine.

17
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:42,860
And then the H-2 is going to have a class of Hetter.

18
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,520
OK we don't need anything on the on the content on the paragraph but down here we want another parallax

19
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,240
container.

20
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,380
So on this div

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,890
and you can have as many of these as you want.

22
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:09,510
And then the image will be image to dot JPK.

23
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,550
So let's save that.

24
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,780
Now we're not going to see anything yet because again this has to be initialized so we're going to go

25
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,370
down here into the javascript and we're going to say the class of parallax.

26
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,910
And we're going to call thought parallax and save.

27
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,160
And there we go now.

28
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,710
Notice that when I scroll you can see different parts of the image.

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,110
So for instance this part of the code in this image if I scroll up it hides it OK so it gives you a

30
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,910
really nice effect and you can create some really cool projects using this effect and it's very easy

31
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,010
to implement.

32
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:55,250
OK so short video but I wanted to just dedicate a video to this this particular component so in the

33
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,800
next one we're going to take a look at the side nav.
