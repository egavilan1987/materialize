1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:00,990
All right.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,570
So we're going to take a look at the side now of component.

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,380
Now we saw a little bit of this in the nav bar section.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:14,660
In fact if I go back to nav bar and the response of one we did here if I clicked that we get a side

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,400
now of that that pops out and that's what we're going to do.

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,710
But we're going to add more to it we're going to have like an image up here with an avatar and in some

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,490
other stuffs some icons and just make it look really nice so let's go back to side now.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,320
And this is five underscore to side.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,400
Now I've aged him now and notice they have a well here and they have an ally that wraps around a div

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:45,450
that has another nested did with an image and then we have a link that surrounds an image we have span

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,830
with a name span with an email.

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,150
So we're going to make this here look pretty nice and be part of the side navigation.

13
00:00:54,150 --> 00:01:04,020
All right so first thing you want to do is take this UL and give it an ID of slide dash out.

14
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,600
Now this idea this can be anything you want.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,600
This is just what we're going to call when we have our trigger to actually make the side of pop out.

16
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,190
So this can be anything.

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,950
All right but you do want to have a class of side dash now.

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:20,910
All right.

19
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:28,470
And then this div right here I'm going to give a class of user view which allows us to have a pretty

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:35,750
cool UI with an image in the background and you'll see once it's once it's added.

21
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,010
We also need a class here of background.

22
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:41,950
OK.

23
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:50,850
And then for the image we're going to use Let's use image for jpeg.

24
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:51,750
OK.

25
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,520
And then for the tag here I'm just going to have it go nowhere so just hash.

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,820
Exclamation.

27
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:04,980
And then for this image here I'm going to give a class of circle member we can do our circle images

28
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,510
and I'll give it a source of image five

29
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:17,120
and then for this link here again it's not going to actually go anywhere.

30
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,670
Normally it would go to like a profile but I'm not going to have it go anywhere.

31
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:27,400
And then for this span I'm going to give this a class of white text because this will actually be over

32
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,700
the image and then I'm also going to give it a class of name.

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,910
OK.

34
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:43,570
And then here on this email I'm also going to give that a class of white text and I'm going to give

35
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,350
it a class of e-mail.

36
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:45,910
All right.

37
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:53,740
So this is like this is very typical of some kind of link to a dashboard or something like that or actually

38
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,370
we have the dashboard link down here but to see your user information once you're logged in.

39
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:05,390
So for the dashboard again this will just go nowhere.

40
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,940
These links aren't going to actually work.

41
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:17,720
And then for the icon we'll add our material icons class and let's make this there's actually an icon

42
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,950
called dashboard.

43
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,640
We'll use that

44
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,630
and then let's see posts

45
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,320
and we can also have dividers just lines that kind of divide sections.

46
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,220
So this div I'm going to give a class of divider

47
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,300
and this account info.

48
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:51,910
I want this to be like a subhead so I'm going to give that a class of sub header and then we have a

49
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,120
logo button.

50
00:03:53,170 --> 00:04:07,480
So I'm going to give that a class of let's do Wavves effect and it's not actually going to go anywhere.

51
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:18,530
Same thing with this here all right and then down here this ATAC this is going to be our activator.

52
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:30,310
So the Tref is going to go anywhere but we're going to have a data activates attribute and we're going

53
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,510
to set that to remember we have the idea of slide out.

54
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,280
This is where we're going to call it.

55
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:35,930
All right.

56
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,310
This also has to have a class of foughten collapse

57
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:49,100
OK just like it did in the nav bar and then we'll have it wrapped around an icon.

58
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,970
So we'll say material dash icons and we'll give this the icon of the menu.

59
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,750
And let's save it.

60
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:04,070
So it's not going to work yet because we actually have to initialize it so we go down here and let's

61
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:14,080
say putten collapse because that's a class on the trigger and we need to call side now.

62
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:15,700
OK.

63
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,290
So let's save that and let's try it.

64
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,220
And there we go.

65
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,600
And you can see this looks really nice.

66
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:28,920
We have our old dashboard link with the avatar and the name and email account info log out.

67
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,390
So it's a pretty nice effect.

68
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,740
Pretty nice look.

69
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,700
And we have some options that we can add for this as well.

70
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,260
We wanted to change the width.

71
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,670
We could do menu with if we wanted to change it to let's say 400 pixels.

72
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,380
Actually we just do 400.

73
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,800
And now if I click it you'll see that it's much thicker.

74
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,270
I think the default is 300.

75
00:05:52,450 --> 00:06:04,060
And then if we can also change where it is so if we say edge to edge right and now it comes out from

76
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:16,090
the right and to put it back to left though we can also do close on click which is true by default.

77
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:16,960
Let's just try it.

78
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,700
So if I click on i guess.

79
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,420
Let's see.

80
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,810
Let's do a close on click.

81
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,850
True.

82
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,000
OK.

83
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:33,760
So if I click outside it closes but if I put this to false it still does

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,390
not exactly sure what close on click does but I know it is an option see that it might have to do with

85
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,560
touch screens.

86
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,420
Actually one thing that does have to do with touch screens is draggle.

87
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,430
So that's true.

88
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:06,840
Now this will allow you to choose if you want to be able to drag to open it on touchscreens or not.

89
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,600
I think the default is true.

90
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,060
So that's what I'm going to keep it as we can also do callbacks for when it's open and close.

91
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:24,870
So for instance let's put a comma here and let's say on the open let's say function

92
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:33,490
and we'll say alert or actually it's to a console log.

93
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,690
And we'll say when you open and then we can also do

94
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,850
on close

95
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,710
say console dot log

96
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,990
in New Clothes.

97
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:05,290
All right.

98
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:10,970
So now what I'll do is open up our console at 12 and let's open it up and we get menu open.

99
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,840
Close it we get menu close if you want something to happen in javascript when you open and close the

100
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,250
side.

101
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,900
Now you can do that easily.

102
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,460
All right guys so that's going to be it.

103
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:28,930
So in next video we're going to take a look at pushpin which is kind of unique it's kind of a way to

104
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,050
lay out your page.

105
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,440
We're going to have to we're not going to be able to use our normal layout because it's going to take

106
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,030
up the entire page so we can have our menu items but you'll see.

107
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,940
We'll take a look at that next.
