1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,780
All right guys so this is going to be the pushpin component which is kind of strange but I think it's

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,710
pretty cool.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,530
Basically we have a couple of different navs here we have three different now as in by default and materialized

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,950
just by having the nav tag here gives you this pinkish background with the padding and all that.

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:27,420
OK so what we want to do is for the div that's wrapping around all of these actually it's wrapping around

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,000
each Nav. each has a div.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,080
We're going to give this an ID.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,870
So this is going to have an idea of value.

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,850
And then it's going to go in and give it a class of block.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:46,020
OK when we use push Pimm you want to use block and then I'm also going to make the the I'm going to

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,380
make it blue.

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,450
All right.

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:01:02,520
So for the nav tag here we actually want to give this a class of pushpin dash Jammo Desch now.

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,950
OK and we're going to give it a data target

15
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,190
of blue.

16
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,190
So this data target should actually match the ID.

17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:21,300
Now inside here this div we want to give this a class of NAV wrapper just like any other nav bar.

18
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,090
And we're also going to do.

19
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,360
I'm going to give it a color of light blue and then I'm going to put a container inside the nav bar

20
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,230
you don't have to.

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,980
But I like to just so things aren't pushed up against the side.

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:42,940
And then this is going to be the logo so we want to give this a class of brand dash logo.

23
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,570
And then we don't actually have to do anything for the links.

24
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,810
Let's go ahead and save that.

25
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:50,800
OK.

26
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:58,520
So we're actually going to have to add a little bit of custom see SS in order for this to work.

27
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,880
And this is even in the documentation.

28
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,060
So I have some style tags here we're going to go inside here and we're going to say for the H T now

29
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:20,090
the body and the block class we want to set the height height to 100 percent.

30
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,500
OK.

31
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:28,590
So you can see it gives it a height of 100 percent and then it's

32
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,000
you know let's yell it's let's move on to the other ones.

33
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:43,140
Now instead of let's see actually one thing that I forgot.

34
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,470
Here is the UL.

35
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:54,230
The UL should actually have an ID of NAV dash mobile and then a class

36
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,950
let's do class rights.

37
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:06,450
OK so that leaves it to the right and let's hide it on medium screens and end down so we'll say hide

38
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,220
Dasch on MGD and down.

39
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,050
OK.

40
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:19,760
So that way if if the screen is too small they're not going to show if we make this bigger they should

41
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,660
the link should show all right.

42
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:34,970
So now what I want to do is just copy this whole div right here and then replace this div like that

43
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,650
and then we're going to change a couple of things we're going to change the ID to read.

44
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,350
We're going to change this to read.

45
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:53,770
I'm also going to do a Leitung Dash 1 and then we want to change the actual color of the Nav..

46
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,460
Or I'm sorry not the color but the data target to read which should match that ID.

47
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:08,700
We're going to change this div right here with the Nav. wrapper will change that class to read in.

48
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,240
Let's just change these right here.

49
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,380
So I'll say red for those.

50
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:28,350
And then what we'll do is for the green again we'll just replace this whole div rate here and we'll

51
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:36,750
change the ID to Green we'll change this to green the data target

52
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,670
in this

53
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,990
plough to change all these two green

54
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,950
and let's save.

55
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,970
So now if I scroll down you'll see that these are all different colors.

56
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,430
Now they still say blue though it's change.

57
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,270
All right at least the middle one does that should be red.

58
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,870
OK so we're going to go ahead and just

59
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,490
say we're going to add a little bit of Javascript to give it the effect that we want.

60
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,350
The pushpin effect.

61
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:35,010
So I think we have a class called Target but it's not it's not a class that we actually added.

62
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,620
You know.

63
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,230
Let's take a look.

64
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,410
The element

65
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,220
it can make this smaller.

66
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,240
All right so we have devised the idea of Wu

67
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,950
teener

68
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,460
right.

69
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,430
You going to do is take a look at the documentation

70
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,350
and go to javascript and pushpin

71
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,390
so that the effect we're trying to get is this.

72
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:22,810
OK.

73
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,420
So I'm scrolling my mouse wheel down and it's moving each one up.

74
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,690
So that's the effect we're trying to get.

75
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:37,130
So if we look at the code here it actually doesn't give us which is really weird it doesn't give us

76
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,100
the markup that we just put in.

77
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:47,930
It just kind of gives us the CSSA the J.A.G. plug in initially on the shelf zation So let's grab this

78
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,740
here.

79
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,280
Actually not the document ready we already have that let's grab this right here.

80
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,490
This target dot pushpin.

81
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:05,140
And then we're going to put this in our javascript's

82
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,250
OK.

83
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:16,400
And then we're going to take this right here and we're also going to put that in

84
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,030
and then let's see.

85
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,830
OK so that works.

86
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,040
Good.

87
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,130
Now there's also some C Ss

88
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,140
So let's grab this right here.

89
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,890
So class for one element is above threshold.

90
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,910
We're just going to throw this in the style

91
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,470
so pace that in.

92
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:57,480
These are not CSSA common formatted so we're going to get rid of these.

93
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,040
So it should look like that would save.

94
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,850
And there you go.

95
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,190
No that's not right.

96
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,350
That's CSSA messed up.

97
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,520
Let's actually get rid of that

98
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:14,890
yes.

99
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,570
And now the green replaces the red red replaces the blue.

100
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,970
Good.

101
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:29,770
And we're using the colors just to show you the difference and just to show you a clear separation of

102
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,660
these things I guess pages we would call them.

103
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:37,660
I have never actually used the pushpin in a real project.

104
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,790
This is really the only thing I've ever done with it.

105
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:46,720
So I apologize that I don't have a better example for you or a better explanation but this is available

106
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,480
if you want to check it out and work with it.

107
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,990
All right so that's going to be it in the next video we're going to look at the scrolls spy component.
