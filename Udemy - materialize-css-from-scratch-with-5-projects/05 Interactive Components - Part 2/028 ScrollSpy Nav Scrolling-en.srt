1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,790
All right in this video we're going to look at scroll spy which is pretty neat it's basically we we

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,830
have different sections of content.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,480
In this case we have who are we what do we do where are we.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,430
So this would be like an About page or something like that and we want to make it so that these links

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,850
over here will be able to click and that will take us.

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,600
They'll scroll up to that part of the text.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,930
Not only that but as we scroll will see a little marker that will be at whatever point we're at.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:30,430
OK.

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,700
So we're going to go over here and this should be a pretty quick video because there's not too much

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,170
to do but basically we have a role.

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,450
We're using the grid.

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:46,200
We have a nine column since we're on a medium screen we have the nine column and three column.

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:46,680
OK.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:54,390
So this div here which wraps around the age four in the paragraph this first one we're going to give

15
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,180
this an ID and we could call this anything I'm going to call it who.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:07,310
And then we also want to give it a class of section and scrolls by.

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:13,750
OK so every section should have a specific ID and should have these two classes.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:23,680
So this next one here I'm going to give an idea of what and then I'm going to give a class of section

19
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,190
and scrolls spy.

20
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:39,250
OK this one here same thing will give an ID of who are not who where and will give a class section and

21
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,270
scrolls.

22
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,460
All right so we have our IDs and classes for each section.

23
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,450
Now we're going to go down to this area.

24
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,270
Here we have the UL case.

25
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,520
This is basically just a UL with some allies and some aid tags.

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:01,870
What we're going to do is on the UL we want to give this a class of pinned now pinned is not specific

27
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:08,260
to scrolls by basically it just makes it a fit it makes it fix so that even if we scroll down this will

28
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,850
stay in place.

29
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,840
OK so you want to make sure you have that or else you're just going to scroll up and you won't be able

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,980
to see this.

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,500
So we're going to do pen.

32
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,730
We're also going to give it a class of section and then Table of Contents.

33
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,440
OK so this is

34
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,040
this is specific to scrolls by we want the Table of Contents.

35
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:30,630
All right.

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,270
And then for the lengths we want these to go to wherever ID that we have above.

37
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:46,330
So we want this to go to who we want this one to go to what.

38
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,820
And we want this one

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,660
to go to where.

40
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,780
Right and that should do it and I just put a margin.

41
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,690
Seven hundred pixels at the bottom just so we can keep scrolling.

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,830
So I'm going to save that and you see that automatically it looks different.

43
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,410
And if I hover over this we have this little red border on the side and let's see if I click on what

44
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,870
we do it'll scroll to that part.

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,450
I go to what who we are or where we are rather goes to that part.

46
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:26,520
I click on who we are it goes to the top and then as I scroll Actually it should it should show the

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,230
border as a scroll.

48
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,320
Not sure why it's not doing that.

49
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,910
Think I might mess something up here.

50
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,920
See

51
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,830
I know I didn't initialize it.

52
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,610
I need to go down to the Javascript.

53
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:55,790
So we're going to go down here and let's say scroll spy net.

54
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,320
So the class

55
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:07,500
of scrolls spy we need to just call Daut scrolls by like that and say There we go.

56
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:12,170
So now the border shows and as a scroll it's going to show us where we are.

57
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,570
And again we can still click and it'll take us to that area.

58
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:24,300
Before I was just doing the standard ID the standard HMO ID but now it's an act actually initialized.

59
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,400
All right so it's pretty nice for like an About page or something like that.

60
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,490
So in the next video we're going to take a look at tab's.
