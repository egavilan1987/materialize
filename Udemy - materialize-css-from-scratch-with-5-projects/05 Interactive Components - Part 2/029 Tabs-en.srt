1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,340
Guys in this video we're going to take a look at tab's.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:10,290
So again if you've had experience with bootstrap and some other frameworks tabs are very popular.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,200
You basically have a line of tabs you click on and it shows the content from that one click another

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,770
one shows the content.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,910
So this is the basic markup here we're using the grid so we have a row.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,660
We have a 12 column row.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,870
And that's where we're putting the UL.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:32,810
And then underneath that we have another 12 column I should say 12 column div for each tab.

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,650
OK.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,140
And then what we want to do is add to the to the right here.

11
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:48,240
A class of tabs OK to let it know that it is in fact tabs and you'll see as soon as I save it lines

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:58,200
them up horizontally and then for this first line we have we're going to set this to a class of tab.

13
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:05,220
OK Cingular We're also going to do call S-3 because we want it to basically be we want three or I'm

14
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,890
sorry for three column tabs.

15
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:08,450
OK.

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:15,580
And then for the tag that's around this text right here we're going to have this go to hash Tab 1 K

17
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,400
and you can call that whatever you want.

18
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:29,250
And then for the second ally same thing we'll do tab call S3 and then for the Tref and we'll do hash

19
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,450
tag 2.

20
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,720
We wanted to call three

21
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,870
in each draft.

22
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:47,060
This one will be hash Tab 3 and then that's fine on

23
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,710
the hash tag for.

24
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,150
All right.

25
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,010
Now if I say that you see that it changes it it looks pretty nice and we can click on these different

26
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:03,490
tabs.

27
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,430
Kind of has a little slider animation.

28
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,300
Obviously this stuff isn't working because we haven't done anything to the content part.

29
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:18,700
So what we need to do is figure out what we want for Tab 1 which is obviously this area here.

30
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:25,790
So we're going to add an ID right here for Tab 1.

31
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,800
OK.

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:40,220
And then we're going to go to the next div add an ID tab to this one will have an ID of Tab 3.

33
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:47,690
And of course this one will have an ID of tab 4 and we'll save that.

34
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:55,920
And now if I click tab two you see we can see the content from tab to Tab 3 and so on.

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:05,650
I don't know why I have this outside of the paragraph and we just yeah this.

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,290
I'll fix this one on you guys but this shouldn't be.

37
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,730
There should be no text outside of the paragraph.

38
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,230
All right.

39
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,190
Here we go.

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,480
So that's that's a simple tab.

41
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,970
Now we also have what are called Sweetapple tabs.

42
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,650
So for this we're going to add to this.

43
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:32,380
Well we're going to add an ID of tab's dash Swype dash demo.

44
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:41,110
And we're going to also give this a class of tab's and K and then each ally will have a class same thing

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,880
tab call S-3.

46
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:51,910
So basically the same thing as we did above the Tref.

47
00:03:52,250 --> 00:04:01,790
So the Tref is going to go to let's say Id tab swipe one

48
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:23,880
Sury a Tref or B tab swipe to one more will do tab.

49
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,740
Call.

50
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,370
Three

51
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,570
and you know it's at the A-Trak

52
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,320
tab dash.

53
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,330
Why dash 3.

54
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,980
All right.

55
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:48,560
Now we want to do is for these divs here we want to match the IDs to these eight graphs So the first

56
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,890
one will be tab's swipe one so will say ID equals pace.

57
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:01,650
Then Id calls this one will be two and then this one

58
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:15,180
will be three Ok I am also going to give these kids a class I'm going to give this a class of call has

59
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,470
12 blue.

60
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:24,750
I want these to be different colors so I'm going to copy that class and I'll say blue this one will

61
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,990
be red and this one will be green.

62
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,340
All right so let's see what that looks like.

63
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,330
So basically each content area is going to have a different background color.

64
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,610
Now this looks weird with no padding or anything.

65
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:49,210
So what we want to do is we want to go down to our javascript's and we're going to say

66
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,220
tabs actually let me see both of these have a class of tabs.

67
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,080
Correct.

68
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,160
Yes.

69
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,290
They both have a class of tabs.

70
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,410
So two

71
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,520
tabs.

72
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:19,660
Actually we can use the ID we use tabs swipe demo.

73
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:29,620
So instead of doing this we're going to do Id tabs swipe demo and let's say Dot tabs and then and here

74
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:35,790
I'm going to pass in an object and we're going to say survivable.

75
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:45,220
The swayable I'm going to set that to true and save and now you see that it fills out the content space.

76
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,860
OK so now we can do that.

77
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,610
I mean these don't have to be different colored backgrounds but I want you to clearly see that they

78
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:57,550
have different color backgrounds are different different content areas.

79
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,210
OK.

80
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,920
And of course arts tabs appear still work.

81
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,110
So that's it.

82
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,400
Those are tabs and that's it for the sandbox.

83
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,490
OK if we look in our files here we've done all the way from 2 1 to 5 5.

84
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,870
So what we're going to do now is we're going to jump in and we're going to start to create some projects

85
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,490
going on the stuff that we've learned so far.

86
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,670
OK so I realized that the sandbox isn't the funnest thing in the world to do but it is necessary to

87
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:33,760
learn the different class names and also just what's available with the framework.

88
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,820
All right so let's go and get started with some projects.
