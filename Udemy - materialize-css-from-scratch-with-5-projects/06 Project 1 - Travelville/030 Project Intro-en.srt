Hey Guys welcome to your first project in this project we're going to build a theme called Travel Ville

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,200
which is kind of like a travel agency type Web site landing page.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:17,880
So basically it's all one page but we have a navigation where we're using the scroll spy component so

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:23,100
that if we click on something like surge it'll just kind of nicely scroll down to that area.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,320
Same thing with popular places.

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,240
Gallery contact and all that so we can navigate that way.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,480
We also have the slider using an image slider with some high quality images.

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,010
And each one each slide has the caption coming in from a different direction.

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,110
All right we also have this search destination's search box where we implemented the autocomplete component.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,930
So for instance if I put an A in here you see we get a bunch of stuff that comes up if I started to

11
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,910
type like a Ruba then it narrows it down to Aruba.

12
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,570
Of course it's not going to do any searching or anything because this is just the front end UI.

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,600
OK then we have some boxes here are some icons.

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,550
These are material icons.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,840
Down here we have some cards with some images for popular places.

16
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:15,300
I'm also using the material boxed component so that we can click on it and it will show a full size

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,320
image.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,840
All right here we just have a follow section where we have some social media icons.

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,080
Now these are actually coming from Fonte awesome because the material icons library does not have social

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,690
media icons.

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,020
All right then we have a photo gallery again we're using material boxed here so we can see the full

22
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,020
thing and then we have our contact form with a couple of boxes for location and so on.

23
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,760
And then just a very simple footer with some flow text.

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,980
All right so that's what we'll be building.

25
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:51,270
Guys let's actually quickly take a look at the responsive version so if I were to make this smaller

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,910
and you'll see we have the side menu here that pops out.

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:03,230
And if I were to make this to wear it around here you'll see that it changes and everything is now stacked.

28
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:10,050
OK everything is in a single row and it looks good on smaller mobile devices.

29
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,500
Ok so so be building guys hopefully you enjoy this project.

30
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,100
And let's go ahead and get started.
