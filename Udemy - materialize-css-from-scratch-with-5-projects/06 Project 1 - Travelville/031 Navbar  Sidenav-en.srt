1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,880
All right guys so now that you saw what we'll be building let's go ahead and start now for the the project

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,550
files for this section or I'm sorry this lecture you should have a zip file called them theme's starter.

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,940
You need to do is download that and extract it.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,920
OK and this is basically what we're going to be using for the next few themes that we build the next

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,150
few projects.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,210
So I'm going to create a new new folder for our project and I'm going to call it travel ville.

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:35,290
And then what I'll do is open that up and let's bring everything over from the theme start folder OK

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,190
and then we'll go over all that stuff.

9
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,420
So it's copy it over.

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,820
Don't move it just copy it because we're going to be reusing these files.

11
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:50,070
OK and then I'm going to open up travel Velle in my text editor which I'm using VS code so I'm going

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,760
to it's going to say open with code.

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,140
All right.

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:01:00,690
Let me just bring that over and we'll go ahead and snap this to the side here.

15
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:01,890
OK.

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,730
And let's just take a look at these files real quick so we have an index each team which I'll go over

17
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,700
in a second.

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,550
We have a CSSA folder that has the main materialized CSSA File.

19
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,190
We're working with version zero point one hundred point two.

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,610
And as I mentioned before when there's an update I will be updating the course it might just take a

21
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,780
month or two after the update.

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,170
OK.

23
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:30,420
But I would definitely suggest using the version that's in the theme starter rather than the newer version

24
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,660
just in case there's any class changes or anything like that.

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,330
And you don't get messed up.

26
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:42,220
All right we also have a main CSSA file which is just a plain just an empty CSSA file for any custom

27
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,100
styles we have in the Fonts Folder we just have our rebottle fonts all come.

28
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,100
This all comes with materialize.

29
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,070
We have an images folder which is empty right now.

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,360
A javascript folder with the materialized mid-fi javascript file and then our index each Tamal which

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,630
is basically the if you go to get started on the materialized side.

32
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,120
It's basically that that mark up with a couple of things added.

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,890
So we have our material icons here so we can use those.

34
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,030
We have the may materialize CSSA file length.

35
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,120
We have our main dot CSSA file for custom styles.

36
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:26,230
We have a viewport for Responsive sites or responsiveness a title which will change through each theme

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,390
and then in the body we just have in each one.

38
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,640
And then the bottom we have our script tags which include J.

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,090
Queery the materialize mid-fi javascript and then just a custom script tag with anything that we want

40
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,610
to do in here such as initialized components or if we want to do some custom javascript or anything

41
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,520
like that.

42
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,490
Or custom Jay Querrey.

43
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,880
All right so that's what will be working with guys.

44
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,940
So what we're going to do now.

45
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,650
And before we start on the body is I just want to grab Fonte awesome real quick.

46
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,870
All right because we want to use foreign awesome for the social icons because they're not available

47
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,540
with material icons.

48
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,150
So I just want to make this bigger.

49
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,670
We're not going to do exact half and half because I want to have a lot of room here.

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:23,410
But let's go to Fonte awesome dot com and version 5 was just released the whole web site was redone.

51
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,840
Now we're using SVGA icons.

52
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:33,380
But if we go to get started and right here you see this script tag this is so we can use the SPG icons

53
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,120
with javascript so we're just going to paste that in the head right here.

54
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,910
And we should now be able to use those.

55
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,730
All right so we'll save that close up you.

56
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,640
We'll just open a new tab and close that.

57
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,090
And then what we're going to do is open this file.

58
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:56,090
Now you can just open the html file on your file system if you want but since I'm using a live server

59
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,850
I'm just going to right click and say open with a live server.

60
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:05,120
And again if you're using VS code and you want that just click on the extension icon and search for

61
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,770
it and install it.

62
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,440
OK and I'll just close the sidebar up here.

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,240
So this is what the theme starter looks like nothing pretty is just a basic boiler plate.

64
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,280
So first thing we're going to do is add our now bar.

65
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,880
So let's go over here and let's get rid of this H1 and I want this NOW bar to be fixed.

66
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:32,990
And if you remember from the sandbox chapter or lecture we have to wrap the Nav. in a div with the class

67
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,750
of nav bar dash fixed.

68
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,300
So we're going to do that and then we'll put our nav bar which I'm going to give a class of Teall because

69
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,730
I wanted to have a teal background color.

70
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,090
Okay we're also going to put a container so that everything is kind of moved to the metal.

71
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:56,690
And then we need our div with the class of Nav. wrapper and inside that will have our branding.

72
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:02,500
So it's going to be a link with the class of brand Dasch logo.

73
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:12,350
And for the treffen I'm just going to put hash home and then in here we'll just say travel vittle.

74
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,030
OK.

75
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,410
Underneath that we're going to want our collapse button for the South Side nav so it will be another

76
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:28,790
tag with the class of button dash collapse and for the Tref I will just put a hash.

77
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,050
But this is going to have a special attribute called Data activates.

78
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,700
OK and we're going to set this.

79
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,470
You can set this to anything you want.

80
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,140
I'm going to say mobile nav.

81
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:46,220
Just make sure that when you actually create the menu for the mobile now it has that same ID.

82
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:53,090
And then inside the tag here we're going to have an icon so all of our material icons need to have a

83
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:59,030
class of material icons and then whatever icon we want we put in the middle here and I'm going to use

84
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,730
the menu icon.

85
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,870
OK.

86
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:08,030
Now underneath this a tag we're going to put our regular menu link so it's going to be a UL.

87
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,190
I'm going to give it a class of rights that it floats everything to the right and then I want this to

88
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,320
be hidden on anything under a large screen so medium screens and down.

89
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:26,460
So there's actually a class we can use for that called Hide on Imedi and down like that.

90
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,220
All right.

91
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:33,320
And then we'll put some allies in here with some tags this is going to go to hash home and the text

92
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,830
will say home and then world do is just copy these down.

93
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:43,260
We're going to have five of these and this one here is going to be for the search.

94
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,560
It's going to go to hash search.

95
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,350
All right.

96
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,720
This one here is going to go to say popular places.

97
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,320
And it's going to go to hash popular.

98
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,210
All right this next one here is going to go to.

99
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,940
Let's see who's going to go to hash.

100
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,970
Gallery is going to be our little image gallery.

101
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:19,840
And then the last one is going to be for the contact so that will go to hash contact.

102
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,420
All right.

103
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,090
Now if I save that we're going to get our now.

104
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,280
Now for the side menu.

105
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,810
If I were to make this smaller those links should disappear once we hit medium.

106
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,720
This isn't going to work yet for two reasons one we didn't create the links yet.

107
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,880
And one we didn't initialize it in the javascript.

108
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:45,120
So what we're going to do is just copy this entire UL and in a lot of cases you'll see the sidebar UL

109
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,780
right under this ul.

110
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:53,330
But since we have a nav bar fixed div right here if we do that we're not going to be able to click on

111
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,000
any of the sidebar links it's going to be all greyed out.

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,990
So I don't think it says this in the documentation but what you want to do is put your sidebar.

113
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,390
Well under this div K which ends right here so we're going to go right here and paste this in and then

114
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,670
just change the class to side.

115
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,830
And we're going to add in the ID of mobile now.

116
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,150
And the only reason we're using mobile now is the idea is because that's what we put right here as the

117
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,610
data activates.

118
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,990
OK so it's going to activate the mobile nav and we're just going to keep the same links.

119
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,320
All right.

120
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:35,140
Now last thing we need to do is initialize it so down in the javascript here within the document ready

121
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:47,860
we're going to just say Gee query for the foughten collapse and we want to call Daut side now like that.

122
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,750
So make sure you save it and we'll go over and click and there we go.

123
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,730
So now we have our side now.

124
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,280
All right.

125
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,900
So I'm going to start the video here and then the next one we're going to move on to the slider the

126
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,290
big image slider with the captions.

127
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,460
So I will see you in the next video.
