1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,360
All right guys we're going to get started on the image slider here.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,830
Now in order to do this obviously we need some images.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,740
So what you can do is you can go into the project files and you can grab them from the EMG folder.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,420
What are we're going to do is take them now and just put them in my IMJ folder.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,110
And there's three images.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:25,740
If we were to view these There's resort one resort two and resort three dot J Pegge those are the three

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,370
images.

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:33,780
And if you're wondering where I got these I got them from pestles dot com P E x e l s dot com which

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:43,110
is a fantastic site for very high quality free stock images so I think I searched for resorts just in

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:49,580
case you want to download them yourself or if you want to use different images.

11
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,260
That's a I think I use this that one maybe.

12
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:00,080
Not sure exactly which ones I use but if you want to use different images that's fine as well.

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,390
So pixels are a great resource.

14
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,800
So now that we have those images let's go back to our aged him now and do what we want to do here.

15
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,100
He just opened this room quick.

16
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,190
What we want to do here is create a section underneath our menu here.

17
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,060
So I'm going to put a comment here and I'm going to say section and this is the slider.

18
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:29,940
Now the way that we're going to weigh out everything in pretty much every project is in sections I like

19
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:37,080
to use the H Timo 5 section tag and break everything up give it its own class and also give it a.

20
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,800
Usually give it a class of section which is a materialized class that gives it some padding.

21
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,960
OK but we're not going to actually use it for the slider but we will use it in most cases so for now

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,330
we're going to say Section Daut slider which will give us a section with the class of slider and then

23
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,490
we're going to have a UL with the class of slides.

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,370
OK and then each slide will be wrapped in Ally tag and we'll have an image.

25
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:12,990
So we're going to say image and then it's going to be in the I Am G folder and we want the resort Daut

26
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,070
or resort one dot JPEG file.

27
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,810
OK.

28
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:25,440
So underneath that we're going to put our caption and we're going to use a center caption center line

29
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,730
caption So it's put a div with the class of caption.

30
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:38,120
It's also going to have a class of center or dash a line like that and then we'll put our H-2 in there

31
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:50,700
and we're going to say take your dream vacation and then and that we're going to have an H 5 and we're

32
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,960
going to give it a class of why is going to give it a class

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,390
of lights and let's say great text and then we want to do text.

34
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:11,340
Dash liten dash 3 which will make it very light.

35
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:16,230
And then remember I showed you on the responsive version I don't want the I don't want this to show

36
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,360
the H5 the small text.

37
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:30,390
So we're going to use the class hide on small only case that will hide it on small screens and then

38
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,060
for the text I'm going to put in Lorem and then let's use 15.

39
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,360
So warm 15.

40
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,380
Tab OK.

41
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,130
And we'll change that if we need more or less.

42
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:46,990
And then underneath that we'll have an eight tag with the class of beat and also the class of beat and

43
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,350
dash large.

44
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,600
And it's not going to go anywhere it doesn't matter.

45
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:59,370
And then for the text we're just going to say learn more.

46
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:06,330
All right so that's up first slides so now we're going to do is copy the entire ally and we're going

47
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,550
to put in two more.

48
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:15,120
So one two more and we're going to say we're going to change this to resort to and let's change the

49
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:26,640
slogan here to we'll say we work with all budgets and we want to align this differently we want to align

50
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,900
this one to the left

51
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,060
and that should be it.

52
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,260
And then down here will change just to resort three.

53
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,430
And then we want to align this one to the right sort of the right a line and we'll change the text here

54
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:52,930
too it's a group and individual getaways.

55
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,270
All right.

56
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,510
So let's go ahead and say that.

57
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,480
Now we're not seeing anything yet.

58
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,720
We actually have two lies this down in the javascript.

59
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,410
So let's go.

60
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,720
Let's see we're going to go down.

61
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,720
It's just common comment.

62
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,110
This will say that

63
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,380
side now of.

64
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,770
And then we'll go in net slider.

65
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:28,430
So we're going to use a little going to use a little bit of J.A.G. here and say dog slider.

66
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,510
We have that section with the class of slider and then we're going to call Daut slider.

67
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:40,550
And then we can pass in some options so I don't want the indicators to show the little dots when I say

68
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:46,300
indicators I'm going to set that to false.

69
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:52,660
And then we're going to set the height to 500.

70
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,670
OK.

71
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:59,260
We're going to set the transition to 500.

72
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,170
Half a second.

73
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,780
And then the interval which is how long the slide stays for.

74
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,690
We're going to say 6000 which is six seconds or six thousand milliseconds.

75
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,440
So let's save that.

76
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,210
And there we go.

77
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,140
So there's our first slide.

78
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,670
It should automatically change.

79
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,780
Gagin see that comes in from the left

80
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,790
and then that comes in from the right.

81
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,070
Actually though you know what the text is too dark.

82
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:42,920
So let's change let's see I said great tax and I spelt Litan wrong that's why I G H T and so let's change

83
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,560
that.

84
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,740
Sorry about that guys.

85
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,080
I hate when I make stupid spelling mistakes

86
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,130
OK.

87
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,620
There we go.

88
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,360
So now it's a lot lighter and we can see it better.

89
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:01,070
And it's important to choose images where your text is able to be shown that you notice the trees or

90
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,730
overhear.

91
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:08,750
So I had the text come in on this side and then this is a pretty dark image so it doesn't really matter

92
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,790
where it comes in here.

93
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,820
All right but now we have our Slider I think that looks pretty good.

94
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,890
So the next thing we're going to do is get into the icon boxes.

95
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,150
I'm sorry the search box and then the icon boxes underneath.

96
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,450
All right.

97
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,690
So I'll see you in the next video.
