1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,000
All right so we're going to start on the search area here.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,930
But before we do that I just want to move the button down a little bit in the slider's So it's really

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,070
close to the attacks.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,140
It's kind of bothering me a little.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,900
So what I'm going to do is just open up our main CSSA and we're just simply going to say the class of

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:26,960
slider and then the class of button inside of that I'm just going to give a margin top 20 pixels and

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,730
that we'll just move it down a little bit.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,960
OK not a big deal but something that I think looks a little better.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,500
All right so now we're going to go underneath the slider section you shall have our section tag here.

10
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:45,650
It ends here so now we're going to go down on this line and this is where we're going to start our search

11
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,400
section.

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,440
So we're going to say section and search.

13
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:51,920
OK.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,860
So section is going to have a class section which gives it some padding.

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:05,340
It's also going to have a custom class of Section Dasch search and let's make it.

16
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:11,470
But I also want to be a little darker so we're going to say dark and actuation of dots here.

17
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:19,610
So teal dark and one we're going to do and we want to make sure the text is white.

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,990
So we want white text and it's also center everything.

19
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,590
Christ that's our section now we're going to have a container inside here to contain everything into

20
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,070
the middle and then we're going to use the grid.

21
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:38,630
So we're going to put a row and then it's just going to be 112 call calling a grid so we can just to

22
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,440
call and we can do as well.

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,840
OK and this is the format we're going to use for most projects will have the section that container

24
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,050
to restrict it.

25
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:55,180
And then the row and then whatever however many columns we're using even if it's a full call on me when

26
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:00,670
it's a full width it's still good practice to have a 12 column div here.

27
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,010
All right.

28
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,670
So inside here will put in page three or we're going to say search

29
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,220
destinations.

30
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,680
Let's just save that.

31
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,750
So it should look like that so far.

32
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,090
And then under that we'll have the input field so we're going to have a div with the class of input

33
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:29,970
field and we'll have an input it'll be type text but I'm going to add some classes to this.

34
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:37,940
So one is going to be white I don't want it to have the standard materialized form field look where

35
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,230
it's just a single line.

36
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,550
I want it to have the you know the box the white box.

37
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,700
So that's why I'm giving it a class of white and then I'm going to give it gray text.

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,860
OK.

39
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,370
We're going to do the autocomplete too.

40
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:59,720
So we might as well add that as well so we'll say autocomplete for our class and let's give it a placeholder

41
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,080
as well.

42
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,310
So give people some hints like let's say a rube

43
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,990
cancn set.

44
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,310
OK.

45
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:24,950
Now when we're using autocomplete you want to use the ID of autocomplete Dasch input.

46
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,240
OK and we went over this in the sandbox as well.

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,240
And we're not going to do a label here the placeholder is fine.

48
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,120
We have the big H-3 so people will know what this is.

49
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,580
So let's go ahead and save.

50
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:37,910
All right.

51
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:43,770
Now there are some things that I want to change within our custom CSSA file I want to add some padding.

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,630
I want to change the font size things like that.

53
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,590
I want to make the with a little shorter.

54
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,000
So 90 percent.

55
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,890
And then just add a border.

56
00:03:52,940 --> 00:04:02,390
So let's go to our main CSSA and let's say dog section dash search and then we want the input that's

57
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,970
inside that section.

58
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,490
OK and we're going to add a padding of five pixels.

59
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:15,260
Now a lot of these re to override materialize so we're going to need to put the important flag which

60
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:23,420
will obviously give it you know you know make it important and it will override the initial style.

61
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:36,480
So font size I'm going to set to 18 pixels and we'll also say important and give it a width of 90 percent

62
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:53,000
and then we're going to say border and we'll do a light gray let's do three pixels solid and important.

63
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,500
All right save.

64
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,310
And there we go.

65
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,260
You can see it changed up a little bit.

66
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,740
I think it looks a little better.

67
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,280
All right.

68
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,490
Now let's see for the auto complete.

69
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,770
Obviously nothing.

70
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,900
Nothing's going to happen yet because we need to initialize it.

71
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,150
We need to actually let it know what's going to be included in the autocomplete.

72
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:21,480
OK so we're going to do that in the javascript's So let's go down here we'll go under the slider and

73
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:30,870
we'll say auto complete and we're just going to use g Kurri and we're going to say the class of autocomplete

74
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:43,940
And then what we want to do is do a Daut auto complete and then we want to pass in an object and then

75
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,880
pass in a data object.

76
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,270
OK and this is what what where we put the auto complete words.

77
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:55,080
So what I'm going to do is just paste these in real quick.

78
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:02,420
So we're going to use like a rube cancn Mexico Hawaii just some popular vacation places and we'll go

79
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,690
ahead and save that and then let's go over here and just put it in a.

80
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,690
And you see we get our auto complete.

81
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:16,750
Now one thing that I don't want is this whole area this green area to extend with the auto complete.

82
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,520
I wanted to go outside of it and I want it to stay the same height.

83
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,260
So we actually have to add a little bit of custom CSSA for that.

84
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:35,900
So it's put in a class of auto complete Desch content which is a class it's automatically included with

85
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,440
it.

86
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:44,330
And we're just going to set the position to absolute so that it basically doesn't it's not going to

87
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,700
affect things around it.

88
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,430
OK.

89
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:52,220
And we're going to set the width to 100 percent and then just the line everything to the center.

90
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,360
OK so now if we save when we do it again.

91
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,680
Now you see that it actually goes outside of this section instead of extending the green part which

92
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,530
is what we want.

93
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,110
All right so that is the search area.

94
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:13,520
So now it's to the icon boxes which is a pretty easy pretty easy area of the template so what's go right

95
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:23,540
under this section and say Section icon boxes and you see how neat this is to have just each section

96
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,530
like this.

97
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,860
This is how I prefer to do all of my web sites and you guys like this.

98
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:35,410
I think it makes things very easy very scalable if I wanted to move the search down.

99
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,020
I could just take this and move it down.

100
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,230
I do this with bootstrap with I would just stand just regular each time I'll CSSA any kind of framework.

101
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,050
I like to just break things up into sections.

102
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,590
All right.

103
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:54,770
So go ahead and say section on section because we want to give it that that materialized section class

104
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:01,130
which gives it the padding and then we also want to give it our own class which we'll call section icons.

105
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:01,820
OK.

106
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:10,070
And then we're also going to give a class of gray and let's do a class of light in the dash for I want

107
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,530
to make it gray but really like gray.

108
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:22,010
And then we also want to center it and then in here will do our container will do our row and let's

109
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,850
do our columns.

110
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,180
Now these are that we're going to have three different boxes.

111
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,330
So we want to do call as 12.

112
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:36,170
So it's stacked so it's responsive and it's just one caught one you know one box across one it's on

113
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,430
a mobile device.

114
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,910
But we want to do em for medium sized screens and bigger.

115
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,420
We wanted to go across four columns.

116
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,790
We want three four column divs.

117
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,520
OK.

118
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,640
And then here what we'll do is use a card panel.

119
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:57,260
So class card panel and then inside here will put an icon.

120
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:09,930
So we want our material it's material icons and we're going to use an icon called Room which actually

121
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:16,140
gives us like a Google Maps marker or placeholder thing.

122
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:22,860
So if I leave it as is it's going to be really small so I'm going to actually add in here I'm going

123
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,800
to have large to make it bigger and I want it to be teal.

124
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,370
So I'm going to say teal dash text whenever you want to color an icon you want to make sure you use

125
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,950
the text not just the color.

126
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:41,390
So teal text and then we'll put an H for and this is going to say pick where.

127
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,040
OK.

128
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:49,310
And then for our paragraph here we're going to say Lorem 10 tabs to give us 10 words.

129
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,050
And then what I'll do is copy the column.

130
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,010
So from here to here and we want to more of these.

131
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:03,630
And then the second one here we're going to change the icon to store and then I'm going to change the

132
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:09,630
H 4 to travel shop.

133
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:20,160
OK this last one here we're going to change the icon to airplane underscore active and they have some

134
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,350
weird names for icons.

135
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,820
And then for this we're going to just do.

136
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,040
We're going to say fly cheap.

137
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,510
OK.

138
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,870
So let's save that suit.

139
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,170
It looks like let's see a spill airplane wrong.

140
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,890
Or is it not.

141
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,270
Oh it's airplane mode active.

142
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,560
That's even weirder.

143
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:43,880
OK.

144
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,350
So there's our icons.

145
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,950
Good.

146
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,380
And they should be responsive so when we get down to here you see that everything stacks.

147
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:51,690
All right.

148
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:56,350
