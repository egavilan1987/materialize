1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:06,510
All right and last video we went over the search destination's area and the icon boxes.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:12,330
Now we're going to work on the popular areas of the popular locations which are basically just cards

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,290
with images and they also use the material boxed component which is just a very simple white box.

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:28,440
So let's go under the icon boxes section and I'll put a comment there will say section and this is going

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:37,530
to be the popular section and I'll say Section DONZE section and then the custom class will give it

6
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,790
is section Dasch popular.

7
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:40,920
All right.

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,230
So let's do that.

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,280
And by the way we're going to get to the navigation after this.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,860
The scrolls by so we can click on the navigation links and it'll go down to that particular area.

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,900
We'll do that after.

12
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:01,030
So let's do container let's do row and we're going to do.

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
We're going to do a full just a full call them here.

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,170
But before we do that I'm just going to put an H for and this H for let's actually give it a class

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,910
of center because I want it to be center and then we're going to say popular places.

16
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,860
But what I want to do is I want the word popular to be to have a teal color and then the places will

17
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:37,440
just have the regular black or gray text whatever it is so let's wrap this in a span so we'll save span

18
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,100
class equals let's do Teale dash text.

19
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,500
OK.

20
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,590
And then we'll wrap just the word popular.

21
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,900
And give it a nice little effect.

22
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,240
All right.

23
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,950
So popular places.

24
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:06,010
And then underneath that is where we're going to put our column or I should say our columns we're going

25
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:13,020
to have three four column divs just like we did with the icon boxes so call s 12.

26
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,980
So they're stacked.

27
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,750
And then let's do medium four.

28
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:19,490
All right.

29
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:31,390
And then each one of these will have a card class and inside here we'll have a card image class and

30
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,100
inside the card image we're going to have the actual image tag.

31
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:46,410
And I'm going to use the resort one J bag and then right under that still in the card image class we're

32
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:53,240
going to have the title which will be in the spans so it'll be a span with the class of card title like

33
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:53,870
that.

34
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,830
And we're going to say cancn

35
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,960
Mexico.

36
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,600
That way the title is actually inside of the image.

37
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,660
And then we're going to go under the card image div.

38
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,480
And this is where we're going to put our card content class.

39
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,190
OK and then in here I'm going to put a paragraph.

40
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,260
And let's just do Warum 10 like that.

41
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,510
Actually it's two Lorem 15.

42
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,220
OK.

43
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,300
And then what we'll do is copy the whole column here which ends right here.

44
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:38,210
So grab all these pasted in two more times and the second one we're going to change to resort to dot

45
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:45,390
J-P egg and we're going to say the Bahamas for the location or the title.

46
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:53,680
And then this third one here we're going to change to resort three and we're going to change the title

47
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,060
to Nova Scotia

48
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,470
and then that should be it.

49
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,200
So let's save that suit it looks like it's here.

50
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,750
Images put sport.

51
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,030
That's why they're not showing up.

52
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,900
And save.

53
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,830
And there we go.

54
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:22,050
So popular places now I also want to have just a button underneath that says contact for booking.

55
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,090
So that's going to actually go under the ROE.

56
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,940
So we have our roll which ends right here and then we're just going to put a new row.

57
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,140
And it's just going to have a 12 column div.

58
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:42,010
So it's to class call as 12.

59
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,420
And let's also Center.

60
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:45,610
OK.

61
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:53,760
And then in here we'll put in a tag and let's give this a class of beat and let's do beat and dash large

62
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,950
Let's do grey and let's do Darkon dash 3 so it's almost black.

63
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:05,080
It's very dark and the trap will just go to hash contact.

64
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:11,230
And then for the text inside the tag here we're actually going to put an icon.

65
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,190
So material icons.

66
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:25,120
And let's also do left so there's a line to the left and the icon itself is going to be the center icon.

67
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,440
All right.

68
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,330
And then we'll just say contact for booking

69
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,650
and save and then we go.

70
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,530
Is pretty good.

71
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:47,110
So now we're going to do the follow section so we're going to go under this say Section follow

72
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,700
and give it a class of Section follow.

73
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:11,020
And let's as far as the colors goes to teal and let's do Darkon to in let's do white text and let Senator.

74
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:22,150
OK so those are the classes we want and then we'll have our container roll and let's do just one single

75
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,140
column.

76
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,950
Or should say a 12 column div So as 12.

77
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,900
And then we'll have an H for in here and we're going to say follow

78
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:50,070
travel ville and we'll put a paragraph in we'll just say follow us on social media for special offers.

79
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,110
OK and then we're going to do our fun awesome icons because remember the material icons they don't have

80
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,530
the Facebook and Twitter icons and all that.

81
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,760
We're also going to wrap them in lynx.

82
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,070
So we're going to put in a tag here with the class of white text

83
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:21,130
and then I'm just going to have it go to h t t p s Facebook dot com and will put a target of underscore

84
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:21,660
blank.

85
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:28,690
That way it doesn't take us off the page of this open a new tab and then inside the tag is we will put

86
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,490
the icon.

87
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:40,180
So it's going to be an eye tag with the class of FHB and also a class of f a dash Facebook and then

88
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:48,010
we want to make these bigger so we're going to do F.A. dash for X. So that will make it four times the

89
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,690
regular size.

90
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,050
All right.

91
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:56,980
And then what we'll do is just copy the tag with the icon in the middle and we're going to do two three

92
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,310
four five of them.

93
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:07,850
The second one is going to be Twitter dot com and will change the icon to Twitter.

94
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,190
All right.

95
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,340
This one is going to be linked in.

96
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,060
Change the icon.

97
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,640
And then this one here is going to be Google Plus

98
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:31,100
and the icon is going to be F.A. dash Google dash KLOS.

99
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,030
And then this last one is going to be Pinterest

100
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:43,430
and the icon itself is F.A. dash Pinterest.

101
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:44,530
All right.

102
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,640
So let's save that.

103
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,500
Take a look.

104
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,260
All right.

105
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,310
Now one thing I want to do is spread these apart a little bit.

106
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:05,080
So let's go to our main Dotsie SS and let's a section follow and then I'm going to target the f a dash

107
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,670
for X class which they all have.

108
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:16,840
And we're just going to set a margin of five pixels top and bottom 10 pixels left and right save and

109
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,040
now it spreads them out a little bit.

110
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,530
All right so expertly good.

111
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:30,600
So now we're going to do is the gallery so let's go under this section and let's say Section gallery.

112
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,160
OK so Will do.

113
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,370
And each time a whole section tag.

114
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:45,760
And we're going to put a custom class section gallery and then that should be it for now.

115
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:57,590
So inside here let's put our container that I put a container for C for follow I did yeah.

116
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:04,690
OK I just wanted to make sure all these sections should have containers and then I'm going to do an

117
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,710
H for here that will be centered.

118
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:21,700
And we're just going to say photo gallery but I want to do a span with the class of teal dash text and

119
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:32,530
put the word photo my phone photo and then over here will say gallery right that way it gives it that

120
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,210
green text for the first word.

121
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:35,790
Whoops.

122
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,990
I need to do that.

123
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:48,280
So under the photo gallery each for we're going to put in a row and we're going to have a bunch of images.

124
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,260
So we're going to have four three column divs.

125
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,560
OK so it's say.

126
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,260
Call as 12.

127
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:05,230
And then let's do em three OK and then in each one of these will have an image and then we're going

128
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:15,440
to get this from on Splash dot com so c h t t p s source.

129
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,640
Dos Sunsplash dot com.

130
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:30,230
And then I'm going to just put a size to say 16 hundred times 900 and then we can actually put keywords

131
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,710
so I'm going to say questionmark beach like that.

132
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,120
All right.

133
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,420
We're also going to give all these images a class

134
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,700
of material material boxed

135
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:53,210
That way they can open up in a white box so let's just try that one image make sure that shows up.

136
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:53,840
All right.

137
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,270
Now you can see it's giant and we don't want that.

138
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:02,120
So what I'm going to do is go into my CSSA here.

139
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:10,600
Actually what we should be able to do is just add a class of responsive I am Gigue.

140
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,370
There we go.

141
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,450
So that will actually contain it to its parent.

142
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,010
All right.

143
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,250
See what else.

144
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,240
All right so I'm going to copy this dev.

145
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,530
Let's put three more.

146
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,940
So that's two three four all together.

147
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,380
And then I mean if I kept it like this it's going to be all the same image.

148
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,220
I don't want that.

149
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,600
So what I'm going to do is just change up the key word a little bit.

150
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:49,770
Second one here I'm going to call travel and this one here will do nature and this one here will do.

151
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:55,520
Beach and travel you can actually put more than one and then they should all be different.

152
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,170
All right.

153
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:03,000
Now I want to have two more rows of these guys so I'm going to grab this whole div right here this whole

154
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,890
row.

155
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:11,960
Class of row and paste it in again and then one more time.

156
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,820
And then let's just change some of this stuff up.

157
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,030
So for this one we'll say beaches.

158
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,720
This one will say traveling.

159
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,470
This one will do bridge.

160
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,080
And this one will do both just basically anything that's outside.

161
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,970
OK we'll go out here and we'll do a water

162
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,270
to building

163
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,980
trees

164
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,780
and for this one will do.

165
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,540
Cruz looks

166
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:01,950
all right let's save and now we should have three rows of images and if we make this small they should

167
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,530
all stack.

168
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,700
Ok snag and see they're all stacked.

169
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,180
Good.

170
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,750
That's our photo gallery.

171
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:18,670
So we're almost there in the next video we're going to start in the contact area and then we also want

172
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:24,310
to implement scroll spy so that we can actually navigate to different areas.

173
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,420
Nice and smooth.

174
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,240
All right so I'll see you in the next video.
