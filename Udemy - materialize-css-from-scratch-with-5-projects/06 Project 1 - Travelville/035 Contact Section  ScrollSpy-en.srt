1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,750
All right so we're almost done with our project.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,550
We have most of the sections here and now we want to work on the contact area so we're going to go here

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,440
and I'm going to put a comment that says section contact.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:23,020
OK so section Daut section and we'll call this section contact.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,880
And then within here will put our container.

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,510
We'll put our row.

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,890
And what we're going to have is two six column divs on medium screens.

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,980
So we want call dog s 12 and then 6.

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,950
OK so we're going to want two of these.

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:55,650
So go ahead and put two of those and now on this side we're going to have two card panels one is going

11
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:02,250
to just have some text one is going to have the location with a collection item or a collection list.

12
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,160
So for this let's do a card panel.

13
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,500
So say car dash panel class and then I'm also going to make it Teall.

14
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:21,650
Let's give it white text and let's also make it Center and then within here I want to have an e-mail

15
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,340
icon sort of B and I tag with the class of material dash icons.

16
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:37,200
I'm also going to give it a medium class and then the actual icon will be called e-mail and then under

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:45,810
that will put in H form will say contact us for booking and then I'm just going to put a paragraph with

18
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:51,910
let's do Lorem 20 20.

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:59,360
All right so if we save that it should look like that when make this a little wider.

20
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,730
OK.

21
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,100
So she looks like that

22
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:13,100
you know what let's make that in each Five see if that looks any better.

23
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,240
Yeah I think that's better.

24
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,860
And then under that.

25
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,770
So still within this this column here don't go outside of it you just want to go under the card panel

26
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,610
which is here.

27
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,460
So right here I'm going to put a UL with the class of collection and we're going to have this is actually

28
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:40,710
going to be a collection with a header so we also want the class with header and then the first lie

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,630
is going to have a class of collection

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,800
dash header like that.

31
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:59,720
And we'll put an H for in here and we'll say location OK under that then we'll have our list items with

32
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:06,430
collection item and we'll say travel.

33
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,470
Travel will agency

34
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,220
travel agency

35
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:35,090
with two of those so this one will just say 5 5 5 Beach Road and will say sweet 33.

36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,480
And then in this collection item we're going to say Miami Florida.

37
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,930
I don't know the zip code I'm just going to put all fives.

38
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,060
All right so see what that looks like.

39
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,440
All right.

40
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,050
So now on this side of this column we want to put the contact form.

41
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:01,600
So now we're going to go into this six column div on medium screens and up and we're going to put a

42
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,950
card panel in it's going to be gray.

43
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:12,410
So we're going to say Gray but let's lighten it let's say lightning dash 3.

44
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:21,110
OK and then and here we're going to put in age five and we'll say please fill out this form.

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,770
OK let's put a class of input field.

46
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,820
And this is going to be the name input so do inputs.

47
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,940
Type text.

48
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,730
Let's give it a placeholder.

49
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,750
Name what's given in the idea of named

50
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,100
and that should be it.

51
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,920
So underneath that will do a label for a name.

52
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,760
Let's save it.

53
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:56,680
OK.

54
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,840
That's what it looks like.

55
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,410
Now we're going to add the other fields I'm going to copy this input field and we're going to do two

56
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,500
three and four.

57
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:14,310
OK so the second one here is going to be the email going to change that is going to change the ID to

58
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:25,900
email and change that type to email and then the four attribute and then this one here is going to be

59
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,280
the phone number.

60
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:38,510
So it's changed the placeholder to phone ID to phone for a phone.

61
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,850
And then this last one is actually going to be a message but it's going to be a textarea.

62
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:50,710
So we're going to get rid of the input type and we're going to use textarea now with materialize when

63
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:58,820
you use a text area you need to use a class called materialize text area to make it look right.

64
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:06,840
And then for the I.D. we'll call it message placeholder we'll just say Enter message

65
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:16,060
and text areas need to have closing tags so let's do that.

66
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:23,750
And then for the label will say message we didn't even put any text in these labels.

67
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,110
Let's do that.

68
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,870
So this will be phone

69
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,610
email and name.

70
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,330
All right.

71
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:48,380
So the last thing we need another form is a submit button so let's go under this input field right here.

72
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:56,950
Say input we're going to give it a type of submit value will be submit and we'll give it a class of

73
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,790
DTN OK which is Teall by default.

74
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,470
So let's save that.

75
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,410
And let's take a look and there's our form.

76
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,850
So that looks pretty good.

77
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,510
All right.

78
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,810
Now the last thing I want is for her and that's very very simple

79
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,440
so we're just going to do Forder.

80
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:23,030
We're going to give it a class of sections so it gets that padding we're going to make it Teale we're

81
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:30,810
going to darken it by two and we're going to make sure the text is white and we're going to center it.

82
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,710
OK and then inside here we're going to do a paragraph I'm going to give it a class flow text to make

83
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:48,920
it bigger and responsive and we'll save travel ville and let's do a copyright symbol and then 2018 and

84
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,460
that's it save.

85
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,960
And then we go and I spelt that wrong.

86
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,870
All right that looks pretty good.

87
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,720
Now one thing this text right here please fill out the form it's a little close to the label right here.

88
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:15,990
So I'm just going to add a simple style and say Section contact.

89
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,970
I believe it's an h 5.

90
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:27,760
And we're just going to give it a margin bottom of 30 pixels and that'll just push it down a little

91
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,370
bit.

92
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:29,970
All right.

93
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,290
So now we want to do is implement this scroll spy.

94
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,560
OK if I click search it should scroll down to search.

95
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:46,330
Now start off by giving the IDs to the content areas so the body is actually going to be for the home

96
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,190
the home link right here.

97
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:56,890
So I'm going to I'm going to give that an I.D. of home and then I'm going to go down to the search section

98
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:05,020
which is right here and we're going to give this an I.D. of search.

99
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,020
OK.

100
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:16,740
And then we want to go to our skip the icon boxes go to popular give that an I.D. of popular.

101
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,560
We also have QAnd whereas our gallery give that an I.D.

102
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,500
and then contact

103
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,730
right now I'll save this.

104
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:40,510
And when we created our now wavelengths we have them go to hash home half search hash search and it

105
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,310
will work.

106
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:49,020
You'll see that I'll go to search gallery or somewhat but it's not a smooth scroll It's just like one

107
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,670
it's just it just goes there.

108
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,900
What we want to do is implement scrolls by OK which will make it much smoother.

109
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:03,750
Now to do this all of the things that we added an ID to we also need to add a scroll spy class too.

110
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:12,820
So for the body let's say class scrolls by and then I'm just going to actually the rest of them have

111
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:21,790
classes so just copy the words scrolls spy and let's go to the search and just add that onto the class

112
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,240
at the end.

113
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:34,720
We'll go to the popular ad that will go to the gallery at it and then on the Contact

114
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,800
skirl spy.

115
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,640
OK.

116
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:46,970
And then the last thing we want to do is just initialize it so we'll go down to our javascript here.

117
00:10:51,540 --> 00:11:04,600
And we just need to take that class of scrolls by and call Daut scrolls by access should be an upper

118
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,820
case s and let's save let's try it out so search.

119
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,990
There we go and you can see it actually goes and shows the top of that.

120
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,470
Why is it doing there.

121
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,240
Oh sorry.

122
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,430
I'm not sure why did that gallery contact.

123
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,870
And if we go back to home it goes all the way back up.

124
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,320
All right.

125
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,310
So that is our project guys hopefully you enjoyed the first one.

126
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,130
I think this is a pretty good looking site.

127
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,640
I mean if it were a real travel agency I wouldn't think twice I wouldn't say it's a crappy site I think

128
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,230
it looks pretty good.

129
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,840
Obviously if it were a production you might want to do some more stuff to it then obviously you'd have

130
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,760
more functionality like you'd really be able to search the destinations.

131
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:03,580
But it's a really good start on learning this framework and how to create some some good looking stuff.

132
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,620
All right so that's it guys I will see you in the next project.
