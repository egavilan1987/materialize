00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,380
It it's going on guys welcome to YOUR NEXT PROJECT.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,480
This project called Chua's zoo.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,470
I'm not really sure where I got that name.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,240
I think it was from some kind of fake word generator but basically this is going to be like a cloud

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,340
a welcome page or a welcome sight for a cloud hosting platform.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,360
And I got the idea for this from Heroku I even got the color scheme the purplish color scheme idea from

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,020
them.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,100
So we basically just have a nav bar and noticed that it's transparent.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,850
It's actually part of the Showcase area here or the hero whatever you want to call this.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,730
So even now we have a couple of links.

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,540
It's going to be a multi-page site.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,450
We have three pages and then we have this logon button which if I click it opens up a modal that has

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,490
an email address and a password input with a couple of buttons.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,650
OK we are going to be using font awesome in this project as well because we have some social icons up

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,360
here.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,450
OK we have this area with some icon boxes the About Us area with a circular image.

17
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:09,420
We have these two these two areas which have an overlay so it's basically an image with a purple overlay

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,360
which will do through some custom CSSA.

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,830
We have some icons for different programming languages.

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,510
We're using a slider for the carousel here for testimonials.

21
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,270
So I have a couple of different testimonials.

22
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,900
And then just a simple footer with some links and the about us.

23
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,140
So that's that page then we have our solutions page where we just have a shorter version of the Showcase

24
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,010
area.

25
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,740
We have some tabs here for different services and then we have a bunch of different features here with

26
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,220
icons.

27
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,970
I'm pretty sure these are material icons.

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,740
I could be wrong though they could be font.

29
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,640
Awesome.

30
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,880
And then we have a button and text and then the footer and then for the sign up page we just have 2

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:01,280
6 column divs one has some headings and text and then on this side we have a form with the name and

32
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,030
email password.

33
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,610
And then we have a select list where we can select a roll and then just assign a button.

34
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,290
All right so that's what rebuilding guys I think it looks pretty nice pretty clean.

35
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,380
Hopefully you enjoy it.

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,340
Let's actually take a real quick look at the responsive version so you can see everything is stacked

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,180
on we have this little podcast.

38
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,800
It's an area as well but that looks good.

39
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:34,800
And if we look at the solutions page and everything looks good and if we look at sign up that looks

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,760
good as well.

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,330
All right so let's go ahead and get started building the core zoo theme in material Lysias as.
