1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,140
All right let's get started on the KwaZulu theme so we're going to create a new folder for our project

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:13,810
and create it on my desktop and I'm going to call it KwaZulu and same thing we did with the travel Velle

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,850
we're going to grab from the theme starter.

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:22,080
So going to open that up and I'm just going to grab everything in there and just copy it and then just

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,400
bring it over to our folder here.

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,030
OK.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:35,140
And then we're going to open this folder with vs code OK so I'm not going to go through the files because

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,190
we already did that in the last project.

9
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,160
Just very simple stuff.

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,950
Let's open up the index each team now and we are going to need font Awesome again because we're using

11
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:50,860
social icons and material icons does not provide those at least yet.

12
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,080
So it's open up our browser.

13
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,170
And let's go to fun.

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,240
Awesome.

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,740
And we'll go to get started.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,300
And we just want to grab our script tag right here for our SVGA icons and I'll go ahead and put those

17
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,480
right under the materialize icons.

18
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:13,900
OK.

19
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:19,070
Now we're going to go down and go into the body here.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,690
Get rid of our each one.

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,520
And this is going to be the header and it's going to include the nav bar.

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,290
So let's create Let's use a header tag and we use the class of main header.

23
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:39,710
OK because you may have multiple headers in on a Web site you may have an article header and use this

24
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,720
tag so it's a good idea to give it a special class or ID.

25
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:52,460
OK now inside here we're going to have our Nav. and we're going to give it a class of transparent which

26
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,090
does just that makes it transparent.

27
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,900
Inside here it's give are now a container.

28
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:06,170
Let's do our NAV wrapper so you'll see some repetitiveness here but I really don't want to do copying

29
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,270
and pasting.

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,380
I think it's better to kind of repeat yourself and drill it into your brain so that when you do have

31
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:18,710
to create a nav bar you don't have to keep going back to either the sandbox or the documentation.

32
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,560
You can just go ahead and create it.

33
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,490
All right so now we need our brand logo.

34
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:37,300
So in here we'll give it the name which is KwaZulu And now we want our mobile now button or link.

35
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:45,090
So it's going to be in a tag with the class of button Dasch collapse.

36
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:51,370
And remember it has to have a special attribute of data activates.

37
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,750
And we're going to call it mobile now.

38
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:01,660
Just like we did in the last project and for the icon here I'm actually going to use a font.

39
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:11,740
Awesome icons so I'm going to say I dot FAA and then also a class of FAA dash bars which is the same

40
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,370
basically the same icon as the menu in the materialize icons.

41
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,410
OK under the tag here we are going to put our menu.

42
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,610
Are you well which is going to have a class of rights.

43
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:34,560
And we're also going to do hide on medium and down and we'll try our links.

44
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,210
So see this one is going to be our home link.

45
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:43,020
So it's two and a tag and it's going to go to indexed all aged him now.

46
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,580
We're actually doing separate pages here.

47
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,130
We're not doing like a single landing page with hash tags.

48
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,510
So that will go to index each tomorrow.

49
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:58,480
And then what I'll do is copy this down two more times.

50
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:09,380
So this one will be the solutions and it's actually going to go to a page called solutions Daut each

51
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:09,900
DML.

52
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,920
And then this one is going to be the sign up that will go to sign up each team that all

53
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,450
and then I'm going to put another ally on me just save and format.

54
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,820
So it's put another ally.

55
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,760
And inside here I'll put another a tag but this is going to have it's going to be a button so I'm going

56
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,380
to give a class of between and also a class of purple

57
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:45,520
K and then this is going to be our log button which will open a motel but we're not going to do that

58
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,150
just yet we close up.

59
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,840
OK so now what we want to do is we want our social media link.

60
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:03,640
So again we're going to put some more list items here so this will go to we'll just have a go to Facebook

61
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,230
and then inside the ATAC.

62
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:19,630
We want the icon for Facebook which is FHB and then F.A. dash Facebook.

63
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,080
OK so we'll do the same thing for let's do Twitter and Instagram.

64
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,890
So I'm just going to copy these down to more so this will be Twitter

65
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,480
and then this one

66
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:46,980
will be Instagram.

67
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,640
All right.

68
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,220
And let's save that.

69
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,010
Let's take a look.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,530
So I'm going to just open with live server.

71
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:01,720
All right now it's transparent so we can't see anything because we don't have our background image.

72
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,070
So you can get the image from the project files.

73
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:15,150
What I'm going to do is just open my folder up so it's the desk top KwaZulu images and I'm going to

74
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,770
bring the image over.

75
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,500
Give me a second here.

76
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,240
All right.

77
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,970
So this is actually going to be quite a few images.

78
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,770
What I would suggest is grabbing them all from the project files now and getting it over with.

79
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,950
So that's what I'm going to do.

80
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,360
I'm going to paste them all in.

81
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,870
And if we take a look.

82
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,210
So this is the main background right here for the showcase but then we have all the programming language

83
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,680
logos the about Logo.

84
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,740
These two which are for the overlays.

85
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,000
So you want all these images.

86
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:59,710
All right now it's still not going to show because we didn't add any CSSA to show the image in the background.

87
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:06,540
So let's let's go ahead and finish our now Wajir first and then we'll do that.

88
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,000
All right so that these are the main links.

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,440
Now under this well we want to have the UL for our side nav.

90
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,680
So let's go ahead and do that.

91
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,010
We'll say well class of side nav.

92
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:32,170
And we need to give this an ID which should match the data activates which we gave mobile nav and I'm

93
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,780
also going to put an H for in here with.

94
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:46,120
So should have put a class in I'm going to do purple text and I'm going to do text Darkon for.

95
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,880
OK.

96
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,880
And let's also Center it and then it's just going to have the template name or the the website name

97
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,250
which is KwaZulu like that.

98
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,600
All right.

99
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,240
And then under that I'm going to put in ally which is going to have a divider which is just kind of

100
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,760
like a line across so it's going to be a div with the class of divider like that.

101
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,080
All right.

102
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:17,050
And then we'll go ahead and put in our main links which are these three Salone to copy home solutions

103
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,700
and sign up and put those right under the divider.

104
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:28,570
Except they're going to use icons here as well so inside the tag here I'll put an eye tag with the class

105
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:42,700
of F.A. and the class of F.A. dash home UPS dash home that in let's see let's change the color let's

106
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:51,710
say gray text and let's say text Darkon for the icon.

107
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:58,990
And then I'm going to copy that I tag put it in here hand in here and we're going to change the solutions

108
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:07,000
icon to F.A. dash KOG and then the last one will be F.A. dash users

109
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,350
OK.

110
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,890
Then we're going to have another divider.

111
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:17,330
So why would the classic divider.

112
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:24,980
And then finally we're going to have a logon button here as well so it will be inside of an ally and

113
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,620
a tag with the classes and also the class of purple.

114
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,680
And we're going to say log in

115
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:46,140
all right let's save that and now it will do is go.

116
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,670
Let's see.

117
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,050
Let's go to our main CSSA file so that we can get that background image showing.

118
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,920
So remember our header has a class of main Hetter

119
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,570
and we're going to give that background you are l of I m g.

120
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,710
Actually it's good to be dot dot slash.

121
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:14,200
I m g because we need to go outside of the CSSA folder and then it's going to be what did I call that

122
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,130
actually.

123
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:21,900
Background So background dog J pack.

124
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,220
OK.

125
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,890
Now the hetter I'm going to set.

126
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:35,710
Let's actually set some other background properties so background size I want the image to cover and

127
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,530
then for the position background position I want it to be centered.

128
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,640
OK.

129
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,210
And then we're going to give this some men height

130
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:57,470
we're going to do a min height of 600 pixels for the header and let's make sure that the color is white

131
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,950
and save.

132
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,480
And there we go.

133
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,730
So looks pretty good.

134
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,360
So we might as well do the content within the header.

135
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,880
So where we want to go is right under the Nav. but still within the header.

136
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:22,490
And actually we'll say showcase here and we're going to do a class of showcase and let's also do a class

137
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:29,480
of container because we want to we want to contain everything with inside and we'll do a row.

138
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:37,190
It's going to be a full 12 column row so we'll just call as 12

139
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,140
actually know what.

140
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,640
On medium screens I want it to be 10.

141
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,470
I don't want it to reach all the way across.

142
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:52,760
So we're going to do m 10 but we will also want to offset it by one because we want it to be in the

143
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,490
middle.

144
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,690
So we'll say offset dash and 1.

145
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:58,700
OK.

146
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:08,480
And then we just want to center everything and then inside here we'll put in h 5 and we'll say welcome

147
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,540
to cause do.

148
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:22,310
And then we're going to have an H one and we're going to say build for the future and then just a paragraph

149
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,020
of dummy text so do.

150
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:28,180
Let's see will do Warum 15.

151
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,120
OK and then we're going to have a couple line breaks.

152
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:41,560
Those couple line breaks and then let's do a couple lengths formatted as buttons.

153
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:48,390
So this is going to have a class of between DTN large.

154
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:55,320
We're also going to do white and let's do purple text.

155
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,020
OK.

156
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:05,670
And then this is going to go to the solutions dot h team l page and the text for this is just going

157
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,180
to say learn more.

158
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,890
All right now we're going to do is copy this link.

159
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,620
We're going to have another one next to it which is going to go to the sign up page.

160
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,540
So sign up each team now.

161
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:27,140
And we're going to change the color to purple and change the text to white.

162
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,610
So white text and we'll change the actual text to sign up.

163
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,660
All right so let's save that case.

164
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,160
That looks pretty good.

165
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:49,650
Let's see I want to move it down let's go to our main CSSA file and let's say main header and we want

166
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,100
to attach the showcase.

167
00:13:52,740 --> 00:14:02,820
And we want to add a padding talk of 110 pixels and save and that'll move it down.

168
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,630
All right and I think I think that should do it.

169
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,800
One other thing I want to do is have an active link.

170
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:16,080
The active class isn't going to show all of the transparent nav bar.

171
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,210
So what we'll do is any link that's active.

172
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:25,470
So this index right here I'm going to give this a class of active dash

173
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,610
link like that.

174
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:38,190
And then we're going to style it ourselves so we'll go back and let's say Daut active link and I'm just

175
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:45,100
going to give it a color of that like pinkish purple ish color so it's going to be a hex value of d

176
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:51,380
8 for 7 for 1.

177
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,090
And we're also going to make the font weight.

178
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,690
Bold

179
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,740
and save.

180
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,560
And now you see that the home has that pinkish purplish color.

181
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,400
All right so I think that's a pretty good start.

182
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,880
And the next video we're going to continue on with the icon boxes and then we'll go from there.
