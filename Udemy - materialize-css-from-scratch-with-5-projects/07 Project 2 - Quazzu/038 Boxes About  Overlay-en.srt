1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:00,980
All right.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,990
So the last video we created our transparent nav bar and the background here in the header.

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,660
The are the header with the background image.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:17,140
Now we're going to go underneath the header and we're going to put in our icon boxes so let's say Section

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:27,460
icon boxes and we're going to do a section with the class of section and then a custom class of Section

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,560
icons.

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,460
So this should look pretty familiar.

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:36,280
We see a lot of Web sites with this with the three of four icon boxes because it looks really nice and

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,340
clean.

10
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:44,800
And it also allows you to specify features or whatever you want to convey to the viewer.

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,770
So let's do a row.

12
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:54,730
And we're going to have three four call them medium Rose arke or columns I should say or does so say

13
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,330
call s 12 and then medium 4.

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,260
And we also want to center actually we'll do the center up above.

15
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,940
I will put the center here like that.

16
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,280
All right.

17
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,920
And inside here let's do a card panel

18
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,180
and I'm going to put an icon.

19
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,920
So when you find awesome I'm going to do I diet F.A..

20
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:32,140
So class of F.A. and then a class of F.A. dash user and then we're going to do three times we want to

21
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,150
make this beggar so F.A. dash 3 X will make it bigger.

22
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:47,070
We're also going to give them a color of deep Dasch purple and then I'm sorry Deep Purple Tex.

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,760
Since it's an icon.

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,160
And then let's also do text Darkon dash to a very specific color.

25
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,120
OK so that's our icon and if I save it you'll see it here.

26
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:07,660
So underneath that icon I'm going to put an age 5 and I'm going to give it a class of grey text and

27
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:19,760
I'm going to do a text Darkon let's do Tex Darkon for and let's say free account.

28
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:20,760
OK.

29
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,320
Sorry.

30
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:21,870
Five.

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,420
And then our paragraph will just be ten dummy text words.

32
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,370
So if I save that it should look like that.

33
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,860
OK so now what we'll do is copy the column which is this right here this div.

34
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,110
So we want to grab that and we're just going to bring that down two more times.

35
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:53,680
And the second one here we're going to change the icon see the icon from the user to the database and

36
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:01,200
then the h 5 We're going to say no and skewl databases.

37
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:10,810
And then this last one here we're going to change the icon to F.A. dash bolt and we're going to change

38
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,860
the h 5 to fast connections.

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,630
OK so save that and there we go.

40
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,710
So pretty easy.

41
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,020
Now underneath that we're going to have our boat section.

42
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,820
So let's go and put a comment here you don't have to do all the comments but I figure that it helps

43
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,850
out people.

44
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,650
So you know exactly what goes where.

45
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,680
So let's say S.S.

46
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,360
and then we'll do us.

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,460
Class of S. about.

48
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:45,980
All right.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,070
I also want to add a class of great to give it a great background.

50
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:56,330
And then let's do Leitung dash for OK.

51
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,300
So that way it's a different color than the white here.

52
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,720
So it doesn't look like one big section you can actually tell the difference.

53
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,430
All right.

54
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,950
Let's do a container.

55
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:14,010
And inside the container will put a row and then we're going to have basically two six call them divs

56
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:22,060
on medium screens and up so call as 12 and 6 on this side.

57
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,490
We're going to have basically some text.

58
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,910
So I'm going to have an H three.

59
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,400
We're going to say about us but for the of the word about I'm actually going to make it purple's so

60
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:48,540
I'm going to put a span with the class of let's do deep dash purple dash text and we'll do text Darkon

61
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,730
dash 1.

62
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:01,900
All right so that span and then that ending span needs to go on the other side of the bow like that.

63
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,060
So about us.

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:12,180
And then underneath that will put a paragraph with the class of flow text and let's do Warum 20.

65
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,380
So have 20 words.

66
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,040
And then we get another call them after this one.

67
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,150
So this column right here ends at this div..

68
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:28,580
So we want to go underneath and do another column as 12 and 6 and then our image will go here so it

69
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,110
will be an image and it's going to be in our image folder.

70
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,260
And it's called takk.

71
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:48,900
Jay peg and then I also want to add a class of circle and also responsive dash I am Jizo so it stays

72
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,030
in its container so let's save that and take a look.

73
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,460
And there we go there are about S..

74
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:02,460
So next we're going to do the four developers by developers section and it will have a background image

75
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,820
with a purple overlay.

76
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,180
All right.

77
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,000
So let's do section

78
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:18,150
developers and we'll say Section Daut section actually you know what I don't want to add.

79
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:18,840
Oh wait.

80
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,530
Never mind.

81
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,720
Forget I said that we're going to do section Dasch developers.

82
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,450
That's our custom class and I wanted to have Whyte's text.

83
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:37,710
Ok so in here we're going to actually do our overlay so we're going to have a class called primary dash

84
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,470
overlay and if he took my bootstrap course with five projects you might see some similarities with that

85
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:43,940
stuff.

86
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,500
We did the same kind of overlays.

87
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:55,050
We wanted to do the overlay we want to do text white or actually no we don't need to do that

88
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:07,700
but you know let's align it to the middle vertically so we can use a class called V a line dash wrapper.

89
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:08,930
All right.

90
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:17,660
And then here we'll put our container in the container we'll put our row in the row we'll put our column.

91
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,540
So call as 12.

92
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:27,120
And also let's actually let's just leave as 12 and then do Center.

93
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,500
OK because it's going to go all the way across no matter what the screen size.

94
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,650
And then it's simply going to be an H-3 that says for developers

95
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,160
by developers I don't really know what that means but it sounds cool.

96
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,950
So it's save.

97
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:55,620
And if we look it's just all white right now we need to add our overlay in our background image so we're

98
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,230
going to do that within the sea.

99
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:08,730
SS Let's first do the image so we want section developers and we're going to position this relative

100
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,310
because the overlay is going to be positioned absolute and absolute positioned element needs to be inside

101
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,890
a relative element.

102
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,690
Okay.

103
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:28,590
And then what's the background to you are l want to go dot dot slash into the images folder and then

104
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:35,970
we want the the image called Code dot J Pag.

105
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,540
All right.

106
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:44,250
We're also going to add the background size which will be cover and then we're going to add the background

107
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,210
position.

108
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,390
Which will be center.

109
00:08:54,030 --> 00:09:05,910
And let's also do a border top came just do a dark gray border talk of solid and five pixels just to

110
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:12,450
kind of separate it and then let's also do a border bottom so I'm just going to copy that down and change

111
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:22,540
that to border bottom and then the last thing I want to do is just add a minimum height of 180 pixels.

112
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,090
All right so that's our developers.

113
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,980
Let's save that.

114
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:31,320
And now you can see we have the text over the image but you can't really see the tax because the image

115
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,300
is so prominent.

116
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,950
So that's why the overlay comes in.

117
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,740
So now we're going to do is the primary overlay and I'm going to put that up at the top because it's

118
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,520
kind of a general class we're going to use in other places.

119
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,160
So they overlay.

120
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:49,880
All right.

121
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:56,670
And then for this we're going to add a background now when you want to have a background color with

122
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,110
an opacity meaning having it be transparent.

123
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,320
You want to use our G.P.A..

124
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,570
So red green blue Alpha which is an opacity level basically.

125
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:14,160
So we're going to say 112 by 81 by 176.

126
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,180
That's the color.

127
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,540
And then for the opacity I'm going to do 0.7 by default.

128
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,740
Ok then we want to do a position absolute

129
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,470
and then we want to say start at the top 0 and the left 0.

130
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,860
OK so basically start in the corner and then we're going to give it a width of 100 percent so it covers

131
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,130
the entire thing at least widthwise and then do the same height y.

132
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,460
So 100 percent as well.

133
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,340
And then we want overflow.

134
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,090
Hidden because we don't want any scroll bars or anything showing up.

135
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:57,930
So save that and now you can see we have a an overlay purple overlay.

136
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,680
So the last thing I want to do in this video is the languages area where we have all the different logos

137
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,080
so let's add that

138
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:22,890
so we'll call this section languages and or let us use language.

139
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:29,450
And then let's give it a gray background but let's light it so we'll do lighting for.

140
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,680
OK and then we'll do a container.

141
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,670
This should be a pretty easy one.

142
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,880
We'll do a row.

143
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:43,400
And let's see we're going to do an H for here and we'll say work

144
00:11:47,630 --> 00:12:00,920
with will say work with and then we'll do a stand with the class of deep purple Dasch text.

145
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:09,110
Let's also text Darkon one and then and here we'll say any language.

146
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,270
OK so work with any language

147
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,650
let's also Center

148
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:30,620
and then we'll go under that age for let's put a couple line breaks and then we're going to put a row.

149
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,360
And basically we want to call them rose.

150
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,040
OK.

151
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,010
So sue because we're going to have six icons.

152
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,610
So it's a 12 column Gred So we want to each for the 6.

153
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,990
So Klatt Div. of call as 2.

154
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,460
And then let's put an image in here.

155
00:12:51,470 --> 00:13:00,730
This first one will be python so will do image slash Python dash logo dot PNB.

156
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,700
OK.

157
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:10,280
We also want to give these classes of responsive Dasch I m g.

158
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,900
And then what I'll do is copy that column.

159
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:22,520
That's one two three four five six and then we'll just go in and change this one to Ruby.

160
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,760
We'll change this one to PH P then we'll do node

161
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:40,450
one C Sharp C dash sharp and then Java.

162
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:49,200
Let's save it and take a look and then we go work with any language and we shouldn't have to edit anything

163
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,880
in the CSSA for that part.

164
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,390
So that looks good.

165
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:58,220
All right so in the next video we're going to move on to the other overlay section the podcast section

166
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,620
and then we'll do the carousel slider and hopefully we can finish up the home page in the next video.
