1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,840
All right guys so hopefully we can finish up the home page and this.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,420
In this video here so the last thing we did was this part here this work with any language and we have

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,900
all the little icons for the languages so we're going to go under that section and we're going to create

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,870
our podcast section.

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,510
So let's do a section tagging.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,340
Do you guys know the deal so we'll give it a custom class section podcast.

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,750
OK let's also give it white text.

8
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:42,570
So the reason that I'm not giving it a purple background through materializes because that's going to

9
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,830
come from our overlay.

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:53,550
OK just like we did up here we want to create an overlay so we can actually copy what we'll do is just

11
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:01,860
copy everything here inside the developers section and paste that in because we do want the overlay

12
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,440
in the wrapper.

13
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,910
We want that container.

14
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,240
We want a row.

15
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:14,800
Except we're not going to do one one full round we're going to do an eight column on medium screens

16
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,040
and in a four column on medium screen.

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:25,350
So let's do right here am eight and let's get rid of the center so we get em a.

18
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:33,760
And then we'll go under here and we'll do call as 12 am for right.

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,550
On this in the 8 side we're going to have an H for.

20
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,470
And we'll change this to listen to

21
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:54,300
the cause zoo podcast and then we'll put a paragraph underneath that and we'll say every

22
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,510
Thursday at let's say 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

23
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:04,780
All right.

24
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:10,660
And then in this side on this side the four call them we're just going to have a link formatted as a

25
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,120
button so we'll do between.

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:23,170
And we also want it to be purple and we're going to want it to be large so beat and dash like I can't

27
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,150
type.

28
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,680
And that's just going to go nowhere.

29
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:33,520
And then inside the tag we're going to have an icon font.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,710
Awesome So it's going to be FAA.

31
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,550
And then also a dash is actually in an icon called podcasts.

32
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:46,020
We're going to use that and then we're just going to say listen.

33
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,680
And that should do it.

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,260
So let's save Take a look.

35
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:58,700
OK now actually one second here.

36
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,880
So we have some CSSA to add.

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,520
First let's go to our means.

38
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:10,480
SS In C I feel like I'm missing something here.

39
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,230
So section podcast.

40
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,320
We have our primary overlay

41
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:28,130
we have our row we have our medium a medium for columns

42
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,960
the overlay is way up here.

43
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,530
Oh you know why because our section podcast isn't position relative.

44
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:47,940
So what's happening is the overlay is looking at the whatever the parent relative element is which is

45
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,220
basically the the the root element.

46
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,360
So it's up here.

47
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,980
So all we have to do is go in here and say Section

48
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:09,570
podcast you know we want to set me in that position to relatives and save.

49
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,410
And now that's down here why this is so small.

50
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,570
All we get to put the image and stuff.

51
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,300
Never mind.

52
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,860
Got a little confused for a second there so let's do our background because we did it the other way

53
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,700
around before.

54
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,350
Background is going to be you are all it's going to be in the image folder and it's going to be called

55
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,430
it's circuit.

56
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,660
So circuit J peg.

57
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:52,670
And then let's do a background size of cover in a background position center

58
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,850
and let's do border talk.

59
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,250
I'll just copy this we're going to do the same thing we did here

60
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:14,010
then under that we'll do a minimum height of 180.

61
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,400
All right let's save that.

62
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,690
And there we go.

63
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,130
But you know I don't want this.

64
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,500
This is too light.

65
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,690
I think this is good.

66
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,980
The overlay for this image because it's a darker image but this is too light.

67
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:39,840
So what we'll do is we'll just say S. pod cast and then we'll take the primary overlay that's in that.

68
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,690
And let's set it to background

69
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:52,360
R-Ga. and we want the same color we want the one 12.

70
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,540
What is it 81.

71
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,570
176 what we're going to change the alpha value to zero point nine and save and that makes it darker.

72
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,550
Let's see what else we want to do here.

73
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:17,150
Let's not change the minimum height because they look a little too big.

74
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,710
Yeah there we go.

75
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,170
Maybe even 160.

76
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,780
Yeah that's good.

77
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:35,590
And then let's check the responsiveness.

78
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,520
OK so looks like we have an issue here.

79
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:39,790
All right.

80
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:48,380
So we're going to change the men high on small screens for both the podcast and the developers section.

81
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,870
So let's go down here and do a media query

82
00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:06,030
so we're going to say Max with five hundred pixels is five hundred pixels that should be at media.

83
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:23,900
And then we'll take the section developers and section podcast and we'll set the men right to say 240

84
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,230
pixels and save.

85
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,760
And there we go.

86
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,660
I think that looks pretty good.

87
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,010
Yeah that looks good.

88
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,440
You know what I want to move that button down a little though.

89
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,300
See this button right here.

90
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:52,650
So we could do to see if we could do section hard cast pod cast

91
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,800
S. pod cast whips and then we want to just add

92
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,700
a.

93
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:11,250
And let's do a margin top 30 pixels.

94
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,660
OK so now that pushes that down.

95
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,200
Good.

96
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,890
I think that's fine.

97
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,040
I mean if you want in the media where you can take the margin off if you don't want that space there.

98
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,620
But I think that's fine.

99
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:39,620
All right so now we're going to move on to the testimonial and the testimonials actually a carrousel.

100
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,670
This section

101
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,110
testimony you know

102
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:02,440
you know let's do Dougray and let's do Leitung dash 4.

103
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:14,030
All right so in here we'll have our container or have our row we'll have a call at 12:00 and then we

104
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,470
want our Carrousel.

105
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:24,620
So a class of carrousel We're also going to do carrousel slider number there were two types of carrousel

106
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:31,490
one was like kind of like the I guess the apple type where it has you can see all the images and it

107
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,640
kind of you can kind of scroll through them or the slider which shows like one image at a time or it

108
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,120
doesn't have to be an image but any content area.

109
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,970
So we want contents carousel slide or we also want to center everything.

110
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:47,810
All right.

111
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,800
And then in here we want our carrousel items.

112
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:56,050
So this will be carrousel dash item in

113
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:06,950
div carrousel item and then we want to give this in a trough which is going to give an ATF of hash one

114
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,500
exclamation.

115
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,770
And inside here we'll put in each two we're going to say testimonial

116
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,890
testimony or one.

117
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:31,280
Let's give it a paragraph with flow text and then let's do we'll put some quotes in then we'll do

118
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,400
Florham 30 tap like that

119
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,640
OK.

120
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:52,770
And let's see underneath the paragraph let's put in some emphasis tags and we'll say John Doe from

121
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:03,170
Microsystems and then underneath actually you know what this AM.

122
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,400
This emphasis I want this in the paragraph.

123
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:19,360
So great here and then outside of the paragraph we're going to put a class of carrousel dash fixed item

124
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,950
center.

125
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,510
And then I'm also going to hide on small and down.

126
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,180
So hide on

127
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:37,460
small and down K because it looks weird on small screen.

128
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:44,590
This is just going to be the button or the link so it'll be a link formatted as a button and we'll make

129
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:52,360
it gray and we'll just say read more.

130
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,490
All right.

131
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,180
So there's our carrousel item.

132
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,840
Now what I'll do is copy that carrousel item div.

133
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,300
So I'll take that and we'll do two more.

134
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,680
OK the second one here.

135
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:16,620
Let's change this to two and let's change this to testimonial to we'll change the name to say Mike Smith

136
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,620
from.

137
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,070
I don't know.

138
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,510
Edge ink.

139
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:35,130
And then the last one here will change this to three and we'll change it to testimonial 3 and then let's

140
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:40,020
change the person here to Karen

141
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:47,440
Williams from let's say teks soft.

142
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,280
OK so let's let's save that.

143
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,360
Now it's not going to show up just yet because we need to initialize it.

144
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,480
So we're going to go down to the bottom here and let's go ahead

145
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,210
and let's say keras.

146
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,860
It also had a class of carrousel dash slider.

147
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:21,610
And we just want to call DOT carrousel but we want to pass in an option of full width and set that to

148
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,450
true.

149
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,280
So it goes across the whole thing.

150
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:32,480
Let's also initialize our sidebar while we're here we didn't do that.

151
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,810
So we want our button collapse

152
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,920
wups button collapse side now.

153
