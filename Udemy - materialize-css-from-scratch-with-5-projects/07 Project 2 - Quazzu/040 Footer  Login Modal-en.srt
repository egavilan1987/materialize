1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,950
All right guys so we're going to get to the flooder and the log in motile But there's one couple of

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,430
things they want to do first with this testimonial one.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,820
The name should be on its own paragraph should be on its own line.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:20,030
So where I have the emphasis right here we want to wrap this in a paragraph

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,860
Okay so we just want to go through that for each of these.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,200
So also be paragraph

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,730
and this one as well.

8
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,050
OK so that's on a separate line.

9
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:50,320
And then I also want to make the font bigger so I'm going to go to my CSSA and I'm going to say carrousel

10
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,860
dash item

11
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,010
paragraph and let's say font size

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:12,090
20 pick 20 pixels important and save.

13
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,050
And there we go.

14
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,880
So that looks better.

15
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,330
All right so now for the faulter

16
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:29,900
I'm actually using the same footer that is in the documentation so we could also use the sandbox if

17
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,680
we wanted to.

18
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,260
But just to be real quick let's go to footer and I want the same set basically the same thing here just

19
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:42,650
different colors so I'm going to copy this whole thing and paste it in and then we're going to change

20
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:54,750
up a couple things so the for the actual for tagging going to deep deep purple as the color.

21
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:02,010
And then we'll say liten Dash 1 and then this part down here where it says photocopy right.

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:09,890
We're going to use Deep Purple and we're going to use dark and Dash 1.

23
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,090
OK.

24
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:24,190
And then we'll change this h five to about us and I don't really want to use this tax.

25
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,860
I'm just going to put in my own sample tax.

26
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:38,790
We'll do larm 20 maybe a couple us and then for the links let's make these into actual length so do

27
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,520
home.

28
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:47,260
So so go to index dot each team.

29
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,960
This one will be for solutions

30
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,900
and then this one will be for sign up

31
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:16,000
and then we don't need this last one OK and then down here we'll say

32
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,770
KwaZulu

33
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,080
copyrights.

34
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,360
Copy

35
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,740
2018.

36
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:43,960
And then instead of more links we'll say Terms and Conditions and save it take a look at it and here's

37
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,510
our footer.

38
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,920
All right so that's done now we're going to do the log in motile.

39
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,400
So for a link to be a log in moto there's two things we need to do to it.

40
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:05,730
So let's go to that part right there which is this one we need to add a special class called motile

41
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,300
trigger.

42
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,110
OK.

43
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:18,720
And then we also need to have an age BRAF which we do but we need to change that value to go to the

44
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,480
idea of the modal which will be loggin dash mode.

45
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,190
OK so now we can go in we can create that.

46
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:32,890
So let's go down to the bottom I like to put any modals we have at the very bottom.

47
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,160
So let's say log modal

48
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:44,430
so this is going to be a div with the ID of log and.

49
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,970
And the class of modal and then inside here we will have the modal content

50
00:04:54,030 --> 00:05:13,590
class will have an H for say a count log in paragraph log in to access your count dashboard and then

51
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,890
will have a simple form.

52
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:26,060
We don't need an action in this form we're going to have an input field and we're going to have an inputs.

53
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,360
It's going to have any type of e-mail.

54
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:37,660
And let's give it an idea of email and then we'll have a label for e-mail.

55
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,010
OK and then I'm just going to just copy that.

56
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,470
Copy that down and then this is going to be the password.

57
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:59,690
So type will be password ID.

58
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,120
OK.

59
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,070
And then we want a modal Fortner which is going to go under this div..

60
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:14,310
OK this is the modal content div we're going to go under that Indu modal dash for her.

61
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:23,850
And in here we'll have an eight tag and let's give this a class of modal dash action.

62
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:35,400
Also motile dash close so that when we click it it actually closes and let's do DTN and let's do gour

63
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,300
and then further text.

64
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,550
This is going to say reset password.

65
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,740
It's not actually going to do anything we're just putting that in we're actually going to put an icon

66
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,270
in here as well.

67
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:04,200
So right next to the text puts to dot FAA DOT FAA dash sync.

68
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:13,080
So put that icon there and then what I'll do is copy this a tag you're going to have another one except

69
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,910
this one is going to be purple

70
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:26,440
and this one is going to say log in and it's going to have an icon of a lock.

71
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,270
So it's going to be F.A. dash lock.

72
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,900
So it's safe.

73
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,700
Let's try it out log in.

74
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:40,700
It's not working because we need to initialize it so we need to use Jey query and just for the modal

75
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,570
class we need to call Daut modal.

76
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:51,280
OK and this should actually be in quotes and save.

77
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,450
And now click.

78
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,410
And there we go.

79
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,600
Can't log in.

80
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,680
So it's actually going to do anything but it has we have the UI.

81
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,100
So our home page is now complete in the next video we're going to start on the solutions page.
