1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,260
All right.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:08,030
So we finish up the home page now we're going to do the solutions page which is going to be pretty easy.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,290
We are going to use this showcase like we did here but it's going to be kind of cut in half.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,020
It's not going to go down as far and I'll show you how we do that.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,920
So let's copy every single thing on the index page so we're just going to do a select all and then copy

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,770
everything.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:31,950
And then we're going to just create a new file called solutions start each team and then we're going

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:37,230
to paste everything in that file and then we're going to go through and just take some stuff out.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,660
One thing I forgot to do is change the title.

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,760
So even on the index page I'm going to go on I'm going to change this to let's say cause you

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,480
say cloud hosting and we'll do the same thing here.

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:02,870
OK.

13
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:03,580
So

14
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:13,830
what I'm going to do is for the header I'm going to change the class from main header to main header.

15
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,790
Enter because it's going to have some different styling.

16
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,530
Well as far as the rest goes the navigation that's all going to stay the same the side nav that's going

17
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,030
to stay the same.

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,340
And then for the showcase that's actually going to be much simpler.

19
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,540
We're going to get rid of the two buttons here are the two links the line breaks.

20
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:42,680
We're going to get rid of the paragraph all we're going to need is the h 5 and the h one.

21
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,540
So we'll leave.

22
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:52,020
Welcome to cause Xu and then this will just be the page name so we'll say cloud solutions.

23
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,580
Okay.

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:02:02,710
And then we can get rid of basically everything as far as the sections the boxes the developers the

25
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:10,610
language the podcast The testimonial everything up until the Forder we want the water.

26
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:17,330
So I'll save that and then let's go up here and click on solutions and it's going to look like this.

27
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:27,250
So let's go to our CSX and let's do the main Hetter inner which will be very similar so I'm just going

28
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,760
to copy this.

29
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:37,160
We'll go right here and paste it in and change it to main header it's main header.

30
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:48,010
In her case same background image everything is the same just the minimum height is going to be three

31
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,830
fifty.

32
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,690
So let's try that.

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,670
OK.

34
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,330
So it's good to showcase.

35
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,600
I'm going to copy this line right here.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,920
And then we're going to say main Hetter in our showcase instead of 100 pixels padding we want 50 pixels.

37
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,280
So pushes it down like that.

38
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:22,070
OK so we basically have like a page title in the header so now we want to do our solutions about S..

39
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:32,950
So let's go to solutions HDMI and go under the header.

40
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:43,740
So B.S. now I'm calling this Dasch solutions slash about because we already have a section about on

41
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:52,260
the home page and I don't want to mix class names up or have double class names so we have a container

42
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:57,330
and we're going to do a row.

43
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:07,650
Right now this row is going to have two columns to call as 12 and then I'm going to do an EM 5.

44
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:14,850
OK so in here we're going to put in H2 and we're going to say what we do.

45
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:22,950
And then under that will put a paragraph in I'm going to do Laura I'm 30 K 30 text and then under this

46
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,680
column we'll have another.

47
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,850
And this one's going to be s 12 and it's going to be 6.

48
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,980
Now you may notice that we have 5 here and then am 6 while I'm doing this because I want this one to

49
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,530
be pushed over a little bit.

50
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,580
So we're going to add an offset.

51
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,200
So offset dash and one like that.

52
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,460
OK.

53
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,890
And then and here we're actually going to have our tabs.

54
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,190
You have a little tab services thing.

55
00:04:53,190 --> 00:05:02,250
So if we go to our documentation and go to javascript tabs or you can go to the sandbox that we created

56
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,440
and just grab this

57
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,320
and paste that in what we'll do here.

58
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:25,380
Is let's change let's see instead of test 1 let's do cloud hosting.

59
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,240
And we'll change this to tab 1.

60
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,480
I don't like Test 1

61
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,020
I don't want this active either.

62
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,030
So this one will be tab two.

63
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:49,910
And then this text here will be cloud storage.

64
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,020
This one I don't want disabled.

65
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,410
It's going to be Tab 3.

66
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:08,290
And then for the text we're going to say cloud database and then we don't need a fourth one.

67
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,900
All right.

68
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:15,100
And then down here we'll get rid of the fourth one and we'll change these ideas up so this will be tab

69
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,460
one tab to tab three

70
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:29,820
and we're going to put some more content in here so let's let's put in age five.

71
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,080
And this is going to be cloud hosting.

72
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,540
Paragraphing will do Lorem 20.

73
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,990
All right.

74
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,320
And then this one here.

75
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,470
Let's do an H5 and let's say cloud storage

76
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:58,200
paragraph and again Lorem 30 and then this one.

77
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:07,160
Sure you guys know we're going to do cloud database paragraph form 30.

78
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,240
All right so if we save that.

79
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:15,350
Let's go to our solutions then.

80
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,530
So looks like that's getting truncated.

81
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:29,660
And you know what is happening is that we have threes but we only have three three of these so these

82
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,780
should actually be asked for.

83
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,440
Because remember there were four of them we got rid of one.

84
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,960
So we want this because four times three is 12.

85
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,170
So let's save that.

86
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,790
And there we go.

87
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:48,820
All right now I want to change the color of these tabs.

88
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,820
That took me a while to figure out.

89
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,580
But there's actually some CSSA we can override to do that.

90
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,950
So we want to use to dot tabs and we want to do Daut

91
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:12,970
indicator and then we're going to change the background color which seems a little weird but that's

92
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:21,780
what we need to do to a hex value of 6 a 1 b 9.

93
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,950
Which is a purple color and we want to put important and save.

94
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:29,700
OK.

95
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:44,070
So that change the actual underline here so we can change the text inside here if we go to the tab right

96
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,750
here.

97
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:53,240
ATAC great here we're going to have a class of purple dasht text.

98
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:59,610
All right so changing the text isn't isn't hard but it took me a while to figure out how to do the underline.

99
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:05,360
So save that and now we have all purple text.

100
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:05,860
All right.

101
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,710
So next we're going to do the features.

102
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:15,400
So we're going to go under everything under this section here and we're going to say section features

103
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:31,780
so section features let's make it work give it a gray background and lighten it a little bit.

104
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,000
So like three

105
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,930
to our container.

106
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,470
Let's do some text.

107
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,120
We're going to do an H for.

108
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,600
It's going to be purple

109
00:09:47,680 --> 00:10:01,100
text and letters to text dark in Dash 1 and center wups should read dot center and then we're going

110
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:07,890
to say powerful and innovative.

111
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:17,240
OK then under that I'm going to put an H 6 with the class of grey dash text.

112
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,580
And let's do text Darkon too.

113
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,790
And let's also line into the center and then I'm going to do Lorem 10 for that.

114
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:29,690
OK.

115
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,770
And then underneath the age 6 I'm just going to put a couple line breaks

116
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,830
just to move things down.

117
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,610
And then we're going to have a couple of different rows so let's save that.

118
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,300
OK so looks good.

119
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,060
Now we're going to a couple rows of icons.

120
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,660
This is going to be icons with text.

121
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,010
So let's do row.

122
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,430
We can actually label these Let's do row 1.

123
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,810
So it's going to be c call as 12.

124
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:12,140
And then medium sized screens will be for column devs and then will have an H 5 and in that age 5 We're

125
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,430
going to have an icon.

126
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:26,040
So it's true I dot FAA DOT FAA dash user and next to that I can say unlimited users.

127
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:26,620
OK.

128
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,320
So that's our age 5.

129
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:37,080
Now under the age five you're going to have a paragraph I forget exactly how long I did try 20.

130
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,230
I think that should do it.

131
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,300
So if we see what that looks like.

132
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,200
Good.

133
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:48,560
So now we want since this is a four column div on medium screens and up we want three of these in each

134
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,210
row so I'm going to copy the column div.

135
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,670
So this right here two more times in this row.

136
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,640
OK.

137
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:09,660
The second one we're going to say scaleable data and we're going to use the FAA database icon here.

138
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,800
All right this last one here is going to be F.A. dash sharp dash line.

139
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:27,950
And then for the text for the text we're going to do data analytics save that.

140
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,320
Good.

141
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,850
Now what I'll do is copy the entire row.

142
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,890
So right from this comment actually this div ends where right here.

143
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,370
So we'll go ahead and copy all that

144
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,180
paste in there.

145
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,730
So this is going to be road to now and then Road to.

146
00:12:49,730 --> 00:13:02,570
This is going to be good hub F.A. get hub and the feature is going to be a good hub integration.

147
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:12,360
And then underneath that we're going to do an FAA plus icon and we're going to say add ons

148
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:24,270
and then this one this icon here is going to be an FAA HDD hard drive and it's going to this is going

149
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,340
to be smart.

150
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,280
Storage

151
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,080
OK.

152
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,640
Actually do we only do two.

153
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,800
Yeah that's that's good.

154
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,820
We don't have three rows.

155
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,180
All right so let's see under that

156
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,290
see that row ends here and in

157
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:55,920
we're going to go right here and we're going to put a div with the class of center.

158
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:04,630
And I just want to put a link here to the Sign-Up page this is going to have a class of beat and and

159
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,680
then Beati and dash large to make it bigger.

160
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:16,480
And we're going to make it gray and it's going to go to sign up daughter aged him now and then for the

161
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,620
text for the link.

162
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,520
We're going to just say sign up for free.

163
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,990
OK let's see what that looks like.

164
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,740
Good.

165
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,990
And then we're just going to put a little bit of text under it.

166
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:37,370
So under the age tag let's do a couple of line breaks and then we're going to put an h 5.

167
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:49,850
And in this age five will do a span with the class of deep purple text and let's do text Litan Dash

168
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:59,000
1 case that to lighten it up a bit and we'll just say have a question and then we'll go outside of the

169
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:10,320
span and we'll say contact our sales team and then under the H5 we'll put a paragraph with the sales

170
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:23,490
team a email address so will say sales will say sales at KwaZulu theme dog test which obviously isn't

171
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,070
a real email address so it's save it.

172
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,690
And there we go.

173
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,320
All right so that is our solutions page.

174
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,550
We have a little tab thing here.

175
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:39,240
Services all the features sign up which doesn't exist yet but that's it.

176
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,200
All right so in the next video we're going we're going to work on the sign up page.
