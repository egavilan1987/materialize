00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,610
All right guys welcome to YOUR NEXT PROJECT.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:09,300
This is a theme called Mad Men or material admen and it's an administrative panel that has quite a bit

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,400
of interactivity I wanted to do a project where we could actually have things that happen in the UI

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,120
and we're going to use some custom Jay query for that.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:24,060
Now this is not AJ Corey or javascript of course so I'm not going to be going over it in depth but I

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,750
did want to just add some snippets and just some pieces of code that would do some cool stuff.

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:37,020
All right we're also going to use some of the JavaScript materialize components like the preload or

8
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,180
the the toast dialog things like that.

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,340
So first thing I want you to notice is if I reload the page we get the little preload or for a second.

10
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,790
So one second will go by and then the page will load once the page loads.

11
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:57,060
Notice the numbers they count up from 0 to whatever these numbers are for the visitors the blog posts

12
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,500
and so on.

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,180
We also have a little progress bar.

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,570
This actually doesn't actually do anything but it's just there for show then we're using a chart from

15
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,450
canvas J.S. which is a chart library.

16
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,580
This is just dummy data.

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,290
It means absolutely nothing.

18
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,920
It's just I wanted to have something.

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,980
If you look at a lot of the different admin panels they have stuff like this.

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,080
It's just there for a show and obviously if you build your back and you could hook that up to it.

21
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:25,760
All right.

22
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,230
And then these comments over here if I click approve or deny we'll get a little toast dialog that says

23
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,850
approved or denied.

24
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,500
If we go down here we have a quick To Do list that actually works.

25
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,710
So if I put in hello and enter it'll actually get added and we'll get a little dialogue.

26
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,000
OK we can also remove them as well.

27
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,110
So we're going to do that with Jake worry.

28
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,220
We have a recent post table right here and that's the main page.

29
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,610
OK.

30
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:57,020
Other than that we have our post page which is basically just a straight up table with some pagination.

31
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,210
Same thing with the categories and each page will have the little preload or only one thing I forgot

32
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:10,240
to mention on the dashboard is if we go down to this button here we can choose to add up at a post a

33
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,060
category or user and these will all open modals.

34
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,610
OK we even implemented S.K. Ed. Which is a wizzy wig editor that gives you like a Microsoft Word type

35
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,530
feel.

36
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,140
OK and if we wanted to add a category we could do that.

37
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,620
And then on the single free source pages like posts if I click the plus it'll just do the post.

38
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,460
If I go to the categories page and click it it'll add the category.

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:45,120
We have our comments comments will have the users image the comment and then a check and a x icon and

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,340
then the users will have the user image as well and we can add a user here.

41
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,750
Not literally as a user but show the modal.

42
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,640
OK we also have a nice looking side navigation with the background image that the users image and some

43
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,590
links.

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:07,460
And then I even created a logo a logon page so if I click logged out it'll go to log in HD a malware

45
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:13,380
we have this nice looking log in form and even if we type something in here it doesn't matter what it

46
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,040
is it will redirect us to index him which is our dashboard.

47
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,380
All right.

48
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,870
So all in all it's going to be a pretty big project probably the longest one of course because there's

49
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,360
quite a bit of interactivity and user functionality.

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,340
It's not really hooked up to anything it's known.

51
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,230
There's no back end or database but just to give you some cool effects in the UI.

52
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,620
All right so let's get started.
