1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,530
All right so we're going to get started here and we're going to start the same way we did the last few

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,790
projects we're going to create a new folder.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,510
I'm going to call it Magin which is the name of the theme and I'm going to grab the files from the theme

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:20,810
starter so we're going to grab all those copy them and we're going to paste them in here.

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:23,620
OK.

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,090
And then we'll open up our folder with our textedit or I'm using VS codes I'm going to do open with

7
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,080
code.

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,340
OK.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,300
And we're going to start off with our index each team now as usual.

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,720
And for this project we're not using Fonte awesome so we don't need to bring that in.

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,450
We're going to stick with the material icons.

12
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:50,510
So let's go down to the where the H one is and we're going to go ahead and get rid of that and we're

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,280
going to start our navigation.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,370
OK but before we do that let's go ahead and open this with live server or of course you can just open

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,050
it with your just open the page to him I'll file.

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:09,050
All right so I'm not going to use exact side by side because I want this to be kind of big and I want

17
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,770
enough room to code so I'll have it kind of like like that.

18
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,800
All right so let's start with the navigation.

19
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,180
So the navigation is going to be a blue color.

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:27,530
So we're going to put a nav with the class of blue and we're going to darken it so it's too dark and

21
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:35,480
dash too and inside the now we're going to have a container to kind of contain everything in the nav

22
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,230
bar.

23
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:44,100
Then we have our NAV wrapper class and inside that we're going to have our brand logo.

24
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,220
So a tag with brand logo.

25
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:57,500
And actually we'll just have this go to index each team how it's going to be quite a few pages in this

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,610
project.

27
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,360
Most of them are really easy though the dashboard is where the most the most code is going to go.

28
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:12,890
So it's easy for the logo we'll just say Madeleine and I'm going to close the sidebar for now.

29
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,990
So we have our brand logo under that.

30
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:24,410
We're going to have our button collapse so a with the class Button dash collapse and we want to have

31
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,110
our special data activates attribute for the side menu

32
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,170
and we'll just call this side nav.

33
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:46,820
OK we're also going to do in addition to button collapse we want this to actually show all the time

34
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:53,960
which is something new that we haven't done yet so we're going to use a class called show dash on dash

35
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,840
large.

36
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,380
OK.

37
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:04,430
And we want it to the right and then inside the tags we're going to put our menu icons so and I tag

38
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,830
with the class of material icons

39
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,490
and we're going to use menu.

40
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,960
OK let's save that and it should look like this.

41
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:22,890
OK now this is always going to show no matter what even if it's big like this if it's small it's still

42
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,950
going to show and it's still going to open up our side now.

43
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:35,490
OK so we might as well initialize our side Wow while we're here so let's just do that side now.

44
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,080
So we'll just take our boughten collapse collapse

45
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,160
and just simply call side now.

46
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,800
No end there.

47
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,640
OK.

48
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,400
Now we don't have any links yet so it's not going to show anything.

49
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,500
Now underneath the button collapse underneath the tag here we're going to put in our well and we're

50
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:12,850
going to give it a class of right and we're also going to give it a class of hide dash on dash.

51
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:21,030
Mead Imedi dash and dash down so high on medium and down screens.

52
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,430
All right.

53
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,880
And then we're going to have an ally.

54
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,050
This is going to have a class of active.

55
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:37,580
This is the dashboard link so say dashboard and we're going to put our link around this.

56
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,610
So this will be in a tag.

57
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,800
And then let's couts move this into here.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,590
And then this will go to index dot aged him.

59
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,390
OK so that's our dashboard link.

60
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,100
Now let's copy this down.

61
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,840
Get rid of the active though we don't want that.

62
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,920
And then this is going to be to the post page.

63
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:16,720
So it's going to be posts that HDMI all the posts.

64
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,960
And then let's copy this one down so we'll do it.

65
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,280
That's three four five and that should be good.

66
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,780
So we have dashboard posts categories

67
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:40,160
which will go to categories that HVM how they will have comments.

68
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,570
OK so the Sugo comments start each time.

69
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:55,900
And then we'll have users.

70
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,790
So those are our main links.

71
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,810
Now we're going to do is put in our side now.

72
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,880
So let's go under this.

73
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:10,940
Well you know just put a comment that says side now and we'll do a UL.

74
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:17,200
Now this you all has to have an idea of side dash now because that's what we use with the data activates.

75
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,700
And I'm also going to give it a class of side now.

76
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,110
OK and inside here we're going to put an ally.

77
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,950
And then we need that little area at the top that has the background image.

78
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,170
It has the the person image.

79
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:33,950
All that stuff.

80
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:39,130
So it's going to be a div with the class of user dash view.

81
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:46,400
And then we'll have a class of background and that's where the actual background image goes.

82
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,710
OK so I have an image of an ocean in fact I'm going to bring all of the images in and you can get these

83
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,660
from the project files for this lecture.

84
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:01,730
So bring over my folder my project folder go into the I Am G and I'm just going to bring these images

85
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,720
in.

86
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,120
OK and again you can get these from the project folder and just to show you what they look like excuse

87
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,570
me what they look like.

88
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:16,130
We have our ocean image and then we just have four people so person one person for Guy that's all the

89
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,390
images will need.

90
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,060
So the background is going to be the ocean image.

91
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:27,230
So what we need to do is just put in an image tag and we're going to point this to I am just slash ocean

92
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,650
dot Jay peg.

93
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:35,270
OK and then underneath that background Div. we're going to put a in a tag.

94
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:42,440
It's not going to actually go anywhere but this is going to be the image of the person and it's going

95
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:49,700
to have a class of circle OK for the source it's going to be I am g and we're just going to use person

96
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,280
one dog j peg.

97
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,390
All right.

98
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,100
So let's save that and let's see what it looks like so we have all of our links if I click this.

99
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,060
We have our little background and the little image of the guy.

100
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:09,870
So underneath the guy or actually to the side we want to have the name and the e-mail.

101
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,160
So we're going to have a couple other links here.

102
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,690
So let's do this

103
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:25,810
let's do the name so we're going to see a span of a class of name and then it's also going to have a

104
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,510
class of white text because of blue background.

105
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,330
So we'll see.

106
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,440
John Doe All right.

107
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,990
And if we look at that you'll see it actually puts it underneath.

108
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:43,840
OK and then we're going to put another tag and for this one we're going to do another span's going to

109
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,590
have a class of e-mail as well as white text.

110
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:55,960
OK and then we're just going to say Jadot at G-mail dot com.

111
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,300
OK so now we have a little name and email and image.

112
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,800
So underneath that this ally right here we're going to start our links and we can actually copy what

113
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,760
we have up here.

114
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,930
So I'm going to grab the dashboard.

115
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:23,250
I'm going to grab actually all of these and copy them and we'll paste those in.

116
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,710
Now we're going to get rid of the active class on this ally.

117
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:35,890
And I'm also going to put an icon just for the dashboard so right here in the link We're going to put

118
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,250
in I tag with the class of material icons.

119
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,880
And we're going to use the dashboard icon.

120
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,810
OK so if we look at that it should look like that.

121
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:50,620
OK.

122
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:57,740
Now underneath the last link the last list item the user's right here we're going to put a divider member

123
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,130
that's going to be an ally within a tag that has the class of divider like that.

124
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,660
It doesn't actually need in a trough.

125
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,200
And then underneath the divider we're going to have another ally and we're going to give.

126
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,840
We're going to put in a tag here with the class.

127
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,920
This class of sub header

128
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:28,230
and this is just going to say Account controls.

129
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:28,800
OK.

130
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,350
And the only control we're going to have is the logo.

131
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:38,230
So we'll put one last ally and let's do an eight tag I'm going to give it a class of waves effect.

132
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,180
We haven't used that in a while.

133
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,400
And then let's have it go to log in dot each team.

134
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,830
And then the text will just say Lago.

135
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:55,170
OK and that should be our now bar and the side now of hey something's not right here.

136
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:55,750
See

137
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,110
see Carl controls some Hatter

138
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,030
that's weird he's at Gray.

139
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,010
So we have users and then our divider

140
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,700
Ah the divide shouldn't be a link it should be a div.

141
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,220
Sorry about that guys.

142
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,380
And you see a lot of the stupid little mistakes like that.

143
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,130
I don't like to edit out because it's just real life stuff.

144
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,820
You know we do this all the time.

145
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:44,010
I'd rather have leaves little things like that and then have a cookie cutter course that that is just

146
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,840
not realistic it's you know every time you create something you're going to make mistakes.

147
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,790
