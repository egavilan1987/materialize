1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,580
All right so in the last video we created the nav bar and the side navigation.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,620
Now we're going to do the stats on the dashboard and we're going to start off by just putting static

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:18,410
numbers and then we'll do the little jay query magic to make the numbers go from zero to whatever the

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,560
number is.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,840
OK so let's go under the nav and I'm just going to put a comment here and we'll say Section stats.

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,570
OK so just like with all of our projects we're going to do a section with the classes section and then

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,930
a custom class of Section Dasch stats and we also want to center everything.

8
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,780
OK so in here we're going to do a row.

9
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:50,860
Use the grid system we're going to do actually different sizes for our different columns for each size.

10
00:00:50,870 --> 00:01:00,210
So for a small we want a full width so as 12 for medium sized screens we want 6.

11
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:07,060
So we wanted to be basically split in half and then on large screens we're going to do three.

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,670
OK.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,540
So three across.

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,820
So make sure you get that and then what we'll do is put in our card panel for the first one.

15
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,540
This is going to be for the post.

16
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,900
It's going to have a class of blue.

17
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,560
We're going to lighten by Warren.

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,890
We're going to have some white text and make sure that it's over.

19
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:31,760
All right.

20
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,250
And then inside here we're going to have an icon.

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:46,080
So we're going to do material icons and the icon name is insert underscore a motor car and that'll give

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,250
us a little alarm.

23
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,350
What is it I think it's a little pencil I think.

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,560
I'm not sure.

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,350
Oh this is the monthly visitors.

26
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,950
So it's like the little face.

27
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:07,170
All right sort of the icon will do an H5 and we're going to do monthly visitors and then we want an

28
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,490
H 3 and this is going to have a class of count.

29
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,110
OK we're going to use that in the Jay script that we're going to write.

30
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:20,370
And for the count we're going to say twenty thousand three hundred.

31
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,490
OK.

32
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,330
Under that we're going to have our progress bar so it's going to be a divot the class of progress if

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,560
you remember those.

34
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,510
And it's going to be gray.

35
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,590
And then we're going to do Litan one.

36
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:34,830
OK.

37
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,980
And then inside here it's going to be a determinant progress bar so it's not going to be the animated

38
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,500
one.

39
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,770
So we want to give it the class of determinant.

40
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,730
Spell out right.

41
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,540
Determinant and then it's going to be white.

42
00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:00,350
OK and then we need to give it a style with the with that's how we can we can show how much it's filled.

43
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:05,990
So I'm going to say the width will be 40 percent.

44
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:12,780
What do they do here style equals should be with colon.

45
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,460
40 percent like that.

46
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:22,820
All right so let's save that and should look like this guy.

47
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,470
Now we're going to do is the blog posts.

48
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,250
So what I'll do is copy the column.

49
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,660
So the Stiv here we're going to grab that.

50
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,690
And let's go ahead and paste in.

51
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,180
That's two three and four.

52
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:52,070
So if I save that it'll be four cross OK.

53
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:58,710
And then once we get to medium screen you'll see it will be two across and then on small screens one.

54
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,610
So now let's change up these cards we're going to go to the second one which is going to be the blog

55
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,600
posts.

56
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,460
So I want to change the color from blue going to change it to.

57
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,310
Actually it's not going to have a color because it's going to be white.

58
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,070
So we want to get rid of these three classes.

59
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,420
So it's just Card panel and center.

60
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:28,570
And then the icon is going to be mode underscore and it will give us that pencil icon OK and then for

61
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:38,380
the text here we're going to say blog posts and then for that count we're going to do 1 0 5 ok for the

62
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,560
progress bar let's do 20 percent

63
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:51,470
ok except I'm going to change the C liten right here.

64
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:58,370
The class where a determinant is we're going to change it from white to blue because now it's on a white

65
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,360
background.

66
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,650
I'm going to light it by one I like that.

67
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:03,940
All right.

68
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,570
So if I save that it should look like that.

69
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,390
So the next one is going to be the comments.

70
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,990
And this one's going to be blue so we can leave all those styles and stuff.

71
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,660
We just want to change the content.

72
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:29,870
The actual comment is going to be mode underscore comment and then the text will change that two comments.

73
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:39,930
Let's change the number to twelve hundred and then we'll leave the with a 40 percent that's fine.

74
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,610
So if I save that there we go.

75
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:48,020
Now the last one is going to be the users and that's going to be white like this one.

76
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:54,250
So what I'm going to do is actually copy the blog post right here the blog post column.

77
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,420
And just to replace this one.

78
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,200
So enough to retype all the class color classes and stuff.

79
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:12,440
And then for the icon that's going to be supervisor account a supervisor underscore count some weird

80
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,660
names for these icons and then users.

81
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,700
And the number of users will be 350.

82
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,890
And for the progress bar let's say 10 percent.

83
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,890
So save.

84
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,690
And there we go.

85
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:36,560
All right so what's the one thing I want to do is make the icons bigger.

86
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,810
So for each material icons class I'm just going to add medium.

87
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,270
The medium class that will make them a little bigger.

88
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,530
And save and there we go so looks pretty good.

89
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,760
All right so now we're going to do is the counter effect.

90
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:06,990
Now we're going to be using Jay Querrey for this and a lot of you guys that know me that follow my YouTube

91
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:14,850
channel and other courses know that I'm not usually a fan of Jay Corey but the reason for that is because

92
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:22,020
I think it's over used for things like Dom manipulation for Ajax when you could use the GPI or you could

93
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,900
use Acciona or something but something like this is exactly what I think J.A.G. should be used for as

94
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,400
little widgets little animations things like that.

95
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,280
OK.

96
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,110
So the counter we're going to it's going to be a couple of lines of code we're going to use the anime

97
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,170
property or the animate method.

98
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,470
So let's go down to our javascript and let's say counter.

99
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:50,850
OK and I'm not going to go crazy with the explanation because this is not a J.A.G. course and it's just

100
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,930
a little snippet of code.

101
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:58,230
I would suggest taking this snippet and putting it somewhere in case you want to use it in another project.

102
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,770
OK so we're going to take the class of count because remember all of the H threes with these numbers

103
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:10,710
have a class of count and we're going to loop through them within each loop K and each takes in a callback

104
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,140
function.

105
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:20,040
And then what we're going to do is take this meaning whatever the current count Ron and then we're going

106
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,910
to call Propp and we want the counter

107
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,600
property and that's going to have a zero default.

108
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,910
And then we're going to call Daut animate and case this is what makes the magic happen.

109
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:42,840
So this animate we're going to pass in an object and we're going to pass in counter colon.

110
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:48,550
And then this dot text.

111
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:53,170
Ok this text is going to get whatever the text whatever the number is.

112
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,080
OK whatever's in that text and then it's going to take in a second parameter.

113
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,150
So after this curly brace we're going to put another we're going to put a comma and then another sort

114
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,060
of brackets or curly braces.

115
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,940
And this is the options.

116
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:14,040
So we have duration as an option which I'm going to set to one second which is a thousand milliseconds.

117
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:19,650
We can also do easing which is like the effect and that's going to be swing and you can look more on

118
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,240
the J.A.G. documentation if you want for other options.

119
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:33,290
And then we're going to do step which is going to be a function and that takes in a parameter of now

120
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,360
and then we're going to take the text.

121
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:45,540
So this was this Daut text and then we're going to round up so we're going to use the math object.

122
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,990
And then Seele which rounds up and then pass and now.

123
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:51,750
OK.

124
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,320
And that's it.

125
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,580
That should actually do it.

126
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,650
So let's save and there we go.

127
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,730
So now within one second it just counts upwards.

128
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,700
It starts at zero and counts upwards and if you wanted to take let's say three seconds we could change

129
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,430
that.

130
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,140
And now it will take three seconds to count up.

131
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,160
OK but that's way too long.

132
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,710
I think one second is good.

133
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,440
All right.

134
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,120
Now I think that we should also implement the preload or functionality as well.

135
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:27,550
Now the the way that this works is we're going to initially hide every section K on the dashboard every

136
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,190
every area is going to have a class of.

137
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:37,130
Right so what I'm going to do is go to the very top of the script tag right here.

138
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:46,960
Before we even do the document dart ready and I'm going to set all the section classes to hide and there's

139
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,790
a lot of different ways you could implement this.

140
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,590
But this is just the one I chose let's do let's say Hyde sections.

141
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,120
OK so if I save that everything's going to go away.

142
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,380
I mean right now we only have one section but it goes away.

143
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:08,410
And then what we're going to do is wrap everything including the document dart ready in a set time function.

144
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:16,830
Ok so if we say set time out and that takes in two things One is a function of what's going to happen.

145
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,690
And then the next is the amount of time we want to wait for this to happen so I'm going to say one second

146
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,990
or 1000 milliseconds.

147
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,130
All right and then we're going to take everything here.

148
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,970
So this all of this and cut it in we're going to put it in the set.

149
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,180
Time out.

150
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:38,620
All right.

151
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,510
And then inside the set time.

152
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,620
So we want to then fade in the sections.

153
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,820
OK so we're going to go right in the document ready.

154
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:58,070
We do want to do it when the documents ready and we're going to say show sections OK so we can do that

155
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:04,950
by simply saying DAW's section and we could do a show but I'm actually going to do fade.

156
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,430
And I think it's a better effect.

157
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,710
So we're going to do that.

158
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,580
So if we save it's going to wait a second and then it's going to fade in.

159
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,460
OK.

160
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,130
And then the count starts the count isn't going to start until it's actually finished until you can

161
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,060
see it.

162
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,800
OK now that's that's great but we don't have our preload yet so let's do that so at it.

163
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:36,410
We're going to go up to our mark up down the very bottom here and we'll say premotor.

164
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,010
OK.

165
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,590
So let's see.

166
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,300
Let's actually grab it from materialize

167
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,610
see.

168
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,070
Where is it.

169
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,390
Premotor.

170
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,090
So I'm going to grab.

171
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,030
I want it to be that big one.

172
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,200
It's going to get this right here

173
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,460
right.

174
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,140
So freeloader big active spinner.

175
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,780
Only this is fine so I'm going to use this.

176
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,410
Now if I save it and we take a look.

177
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:19,840
The freeloaders is going to be its relative right but we want to position it absolute.

178
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:29,780
So well we'll have to do is edit our CSSA So remember we have the main CSSA file for custom stuff and

179
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:38,330
I'm also going to give it a class of loader like that so that we can grab onto that civil say Dot loader

180
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,880
and then we're going to send it through position.

181
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:58,070
Absolute and I'm going to set it from the Top 40 percent and from the left 47 percent and we'll save

182
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,590
it and I can see it's in the middle.

183
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:06,240
OK so if I reload it waits a second and then loads.

184
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,970
But the freeloader is still there.

185
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:14,470
So what we need to do is when everything comes in when the section comes in we then want to hide the

186
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,830
freeloader.

187
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:23,380
All right so what we'll do is let's say hide freeloader

188
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:34,100
So remember it has a class of load so grab onto that and we'll say fade out.

189
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:40,180
All right so save it pre-loading there sections come in and the preload or fades out.

190
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,040
OK so it's as easy as that.

191
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,190
And like I said there's there's a million ways to do stuff like this.

192
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,550
This is just one of them.

193
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,950
If you have a different way that's fine.

194
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:58,780
I just want to get it working and and you know as long as it has good performance.

195
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,850
All right so that's going to be it for this section or the arms or this lecture or guys in the next

196
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,990
video we're going to start to work on the chart area.

197
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,390
We're going to work with canvas JSL a little bit.

198
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,110
So I will see you in the next video.
