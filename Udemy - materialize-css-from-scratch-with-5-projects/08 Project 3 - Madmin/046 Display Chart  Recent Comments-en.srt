1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,950
All right guys so in this video we're going to set up the part of the dashboard that has the chart in

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,290
the comments.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:13,620
So what we're going to use canvas J.S. which is a chart library a javascript chart library age HTML

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,060
5 library.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,390
But we're not going to learn about it.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,720
It's just too it's just to fill a spot and make it look good.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,400
This is a materialized course.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,540
Again we're not going to be learning about javascript charts.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,880
So what we need to do is just include the script and then I just have some javascript that I'm going

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,100
to pop in and you can actually grab from the resource files.

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,060
So first thing we need to do is bring in charge.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,840
Now I'm not going to download it and include it locally.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,870
I'm going to use their CD and so I'm going to go to our index each time I'll file.

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:55,250
And let's go down to where we have our scripts and we'll go right after the materialized script and

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:08,470
right above our custom script tag and let's say script source and it's going to be HTP ass Kandis.

16
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:25,730
Ass dot com slash assets slash script slash canvas office canvas J.S. dog men dog.

17
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,860
J.S. Okay.

18
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,100
So that's going to bring in the script for us.

19
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,390
Let's save it and make sure we have no errors in the console.

20
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,820
We had F 12.

21
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,960
All right so that should be working.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,200
Now we're going to create a file in our JSA folder called chart.

23
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,950
J.S. OK and this is where we're going to put our chart data.

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,310
Again if you if you're really interested in canvass SJS I'd suggest looking at the documentation.

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,820
It's pretty good actually you see

26
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,330
charts gallery.

27
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,480
So these are all the different types of charts we're going to do a line chart

28
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:17,410
and see something like this simple line chart yes.

29
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,310
Also this is the exact chart I want to use.

30
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,850
Good.

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,500
I couldn't find it before but you can see they are already in.

32
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,760
They include the script which we just did and then we want a chart container wherever we want to put

33
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,280
the chart.

34
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,640
So we want to live like this.

35
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,530
So I'm actually going to just copy that.

36
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:45,470
You guys can just type in and it's a simple line but let's go to right under the stats section and above

37
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,670
the pre-loading the freeloader is always going to stay at the bottom.

38
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:59,090
So right here we'll say section and we'll call it visiters that's what this chart is mimicking So it's

39
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:10,140
a section Daut section Daut section Dasch visitors.

40
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,800
All right.

41
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,950
And then let's see what else did I want to do here.

42
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,730
I want to make this I want to give it a light blue background so we're going to do blue and then liten

43
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,170
dash four.

44
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,830
All right.

45
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:39,080
And then we'll put a row and let's do call as 12 am 6 so it's split in half on medium scratch screens

46
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,120
and then l 8.

47
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,240
OK so it's bigger on larger screens.

48
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,770
And let's see we're going to put a card panel here

49
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,810
so in this card panel is where we want the chart container so I'm going to paste that in and it's going

50
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:01,620
to be 300 pixels height height 100 percent with.

51
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:02,600
OK.

52
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,790
And then we're going to have another column.

53
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:17,420
So after this one we'll have another column so call it will be as 12 medium 6 and then l4.

54
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,530
OK and this is where the comments will go.

55
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm not going to do it just yet though but I'll just put a comment that we're going to put the comments

56
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,270
here and cry Christ let's save that.

57
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,170
Now if we look at it we're not going to see any chart yet because we haven't added that that code.

58
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,010
So what we'll do is go to our Candis Web site here the sample chart.

59
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:48,930
And we're going to grab everything that's in the script tag tags so from here to here the window dot

60
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,960
on load.

61
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,770
And we're going to copy it and we're going to go and pasted in chart.

62
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:07,270
OK so this is basically this is our char Except they're going to change the text to daily visitors and

63
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:13,920
we'll save it and if we go back to our page here OK we're not loading chart.

64
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,240
So we need to do that.

65
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:23,020
So let's go back to our index aged him now and we'll go right down here and see script source is going

66
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,480
to be in our J s folder and then chart.

67
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,260
James

68
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,460
OK.

69
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,110
Now this actually took me quite a while to figure out what was going on here.

70
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,510
If I remove the preloaded functionality where we wait that one second.

71
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,140
This chart looks fine once they added the freeloader it messed up.

72
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:51,680
And the reason for that is it's loading the dimensions and stuff before the page loads because remember

73
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,020
we're waiting that that extra second for the page to load.

74
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:04,150
So to fix this all we need to do is go into our chart J.S. and see where we actually call chart render.

75
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:11,270
We just need to wrap that in a set time out and basically have it wait one second just like we did with

76
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,930
the rest of the sections.

77
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,240
OK so a set time takes in a function

78
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:26,090
and also a time which should be one second just like should match the other set timeout and then we're

79
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,440
just going to move this in here.

80
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,770
OK so now if I save now the chart looks good.

81
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,470
OK so make sure you do that.

82
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,760
In order for this to actually look normal.

83
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,580
All right so that's all set.

84
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:48,770
Now we can close up charg As we shouldn't need that anymore and we're going to go down or go up rather

85
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,500
to where we put the comments in the latest comments.

86
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:58,700
OK so this is actually going to be a collection so remember are you well with the class of collection.

87
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:08,240
And it's also going to have a head or so we want the with Dash head or class.

88
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,910
And I'm also going to give it a class of latest Dasch comments.

89
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:14,970
Okay.

90
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:23,270
And then here let's put a list item with the class of collection dash Hetter.

91
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:32,040
And we'll say latest comments like that saves you what it looks like.

92
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,060
All right.

93
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,240
That should actually be an age five

94
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,910
so age five.

95
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,880
There you go.

96
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,250
Now below that we're going to use an avatar collection.

97
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,210
So are a collection item.

98
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:58,420
So it's going to be an ally with the class of collection dash item but it's also going to have a class

99
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,400
of Avatar came.

100
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:08,560
Remember we did all this stuff in the sandbox so we're going to have an image of the person and it's

101
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,340
going to be a circle.

102
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,830
So we want to give it a class of circle.

103
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:21,330
The image will be an I am g slash person person one dot J Pag.

104
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:28,260
So if I save that we get our little guy there and let's give them a title so under the image will have

105
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:36,030
a span with the class of title and we'll give them the name John Doe.

106
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,410
OK then we'll have his comment.

107
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,100
Now I will add the comment.

108
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,030
I don't want it to display the whole thing because the comment could be very long.

109
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:50,050
So what we'll do is give it the class of truncate which automatically truncates whatever the text is.

110
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:59,940
So if I say Warum 30 tab and save it doesn't show off all of the 30 words it truncates it which is what

111
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,810
we want.

112
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,760
OK I actually want that.

113
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,620
That's right.

114
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,170
But then under the paragraph I want a couple links to approve or deny.

115
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:21,900
So we're going to do a with the class of approve spelled it wrong and they approve and say We're also

116
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,860
going to give it a class of green dash text.

117
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:40,580
See it's not going to actually go anywhere let's say prove high and then we'll put a little pipe character

118
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,340
here space and then let's do another link.

119
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,010
So we'll go like that and we'll change this one to D-NY

120
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,730
and we'll change this to read text

121
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:07,250
I save that but they should say denie.

122
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,480
All right so now we have a prove and deny.

123
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,120
So now all I'm going to do is copy this list item

124
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:26,950
and we'll do two more and then we'll just change the second one to person two will change the name here

125
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,260
to say Steve Smith.

126
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,190
This next one will be person three.

127
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:41,250
And let's change the name to let's say Allen Williams and save.

128
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,050
And there we go.

129
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,670
So now we have our latest comments.

130
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,250
Now we want to add the functionality where if we click approve or deny it gives us a little toast dialog

131
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,950
that says comment approver comment denied.

132
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:00,370
So we're going to use Jay curry for that so we're going to go down here under the counter and we'll

133
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,930
say comments

134
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,170
prove and deny so very easy.

135
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:21,430
All we have to do is grab onto the class of proof and we'll say when we click that was so when we clicked

136
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:26,020
that we want a function.

137
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,610
Now it's a link so I want to stop the default behavior so we passed in an event parameter here and then

138
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:37,200
we simply do e Daut prevent default like that.

139
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:37,950
OK.

140
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,260
And then and here is where we want to do our toes.

141
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:49,470
Remember the materialize Daut toast and it takes in a message which will be comments

142
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:57,570
approved and then it takes in a second parameter of the time it's there for which will be three seconds.

143
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,400
OK and then we'll do the same thing for nice we're going to I'm going to take this.

144
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:15,460
Copy it down and then just change the class to deny and we'll change the message to comment denied.

145
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:22,030
All right so let's save that and let's go and click approve and then we go comment approved or clicked

146
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,060
deny comment denied.

147
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,630
All right.
