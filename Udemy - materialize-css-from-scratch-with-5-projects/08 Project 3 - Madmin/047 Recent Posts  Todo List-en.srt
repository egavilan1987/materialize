1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,700
All right guys so in this video we're going to do the recent post table and we're going to do the To

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,510
Do list.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,450
OK I'm not sure if we're going to get to the functionality of the To Do List.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,340
We'll see how much time we have.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,550
So let's go right below the section we just did with the chart.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,420
Still above the preload or the preload or and all the Modals should always stay at the bottom.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,570
OK after all the sections.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:29,650
So we're going to say section and we'll just call this recent posts and to do these.

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:40,480
OK so we'll say Section Daut section and we're going to also give it a class of just Section Dasch recent.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,810
OK and then we're going to do a row inside that row will have a column and we're going to do as 12.

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:55,940
So that's stacked on mobile devices l 8 k so large screen will be an 8 column and on medium screens

12
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,790
it will be a six column div.

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,370
And inside here we're going to have a card and we're going to do our card content

14
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:17,340
and we want to have a title so we'll do a span with the class of card title and the title is just going

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,860
to say recent post or recent posts.

16
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,460
OK.

17
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,260
And then underneath that we'll have a table and we're going to do a Streitz table so we'll give it a

18
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:37,600
class of striped and then we'll have a T head.

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:47,400
So our table headings which will have a table row and then some th's which will have a title and a category

20
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,430
and then just a blank th.

21
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:56,460
Because that's where you go outside of the shoe go right here so that that will be where the details

22
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,080
button goes.

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:05,760
All right so under the t head let's put our t body and inside here we're going to have some table rows

24
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,060
so this will have a table column which is a T tag and we'll say post one

25
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:22,680
and then the category I'm going to say web development and then we want another D.

26
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,360
This is going to be the details button or details length.

27
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:35,900
So we'll put in a tag and I'm going to give it a class of between blue and white dash 2.

28
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,810
OK and it's going to go to details dot each team male

29
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,340
and let's see.

30
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:52,970
Actually no it's not going to go to details are going to go let's see actually details aged him out.

31
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,920
And then here we'll just say details like that.

32
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,710
All right so the rest of the posts will be for the rest of the rows will be the same except the content

33
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:14,990
so I'm just going to copy the TR and put it in two more times and then this one will be post 2 category

34
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,860
will say graphic design.

35
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:28,450
And then this one down here let's do post 3.

36
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:34,390
And we'll keep web development for the title or for the category.

37
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,560
All right so this is what it will look like.

38
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,380
Now on this side we're going to have to do.

39
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:48,030
So let's go create another column so this column right here ends here at this div So we want to go right

40
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,020
under it and do another column as 12.

41
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,940
And on medium screens it will be six.

42
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,970
It will be split in half.

43
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,120
And on large screens it will be four

44
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:05,100
now the dues are also going to go inside of a card.

45
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,470
So we'll see a card

46
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:19,160
card content's they'll have a title which will go in a span so card dash title and we'll just say quick

47
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,740
to do this.

48
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:32,030
All right then we're going to have a form I'm going to give an ID of to do dash form no action.

49
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:36,680
We're going to use J.A.G. to grab onto the form by the ID.

50
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,580
All right.

51
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,690
And then we'll have an input field div

52
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,890
and inside here we're just going to have an input no label just the input.

53
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,820
And I'm actually going to give an ID so that we can grab on to it.

54
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,690
And Jay query of to do.

55
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:05,330
And then we'll add a little placeholder that will say add to do like that.

56
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,020
OK.

57
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,820
And then if we save that that's what it will look like.

58
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,920
Now I'm going to add some initial to do's.

59
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,890
They're going to be in a collection.

60
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:20,660
So under the form we're going to have a well with the class of collection.

61
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:28,400
And let's also give it a class of two do's and then inside here we're going to have a list item with

62
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,060
the class of collection item.

63
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,990
Now they're also going to have some secondary content.

64
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:42,950
We want the X so that we can delete that to do so we're going to put a div and we'll put a title say

65
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:53,270
to do one and then we want in a tag with the class of secondary content.

66
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,570
And we also want to give it a class of delete so that we can grab onto it.

67
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:58,470
All right.

68
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:05,510
And then inside that this is just going to go to a hash and an exclamation it's not going to go anywhere

69
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:16,190
but inside the tag what's inside the tag we're going to have an icon so material icons and it's going

70
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,590
to be a close eye soon to be an X.

71
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,240
So if I save that it's going to look like this.

72
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,770
OK and I'll put one more so.

73
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,400
Copy that.

74
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:34,430
Ally and will just change that to to do two and say.

75
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,600
All right.

76
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,770
So that's the mark up.

77
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,660
So I guess we have time to do the functionality.

78
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:50,330
Now one thing I forgot to do is I want the body to have a darker color than these white cards.

79
00:06:50,330 --> 00:07:00,030
OK so what we'll do is on the body tag we're going to have a class of gray and then lightning dash for

80
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,290
and save.

81
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:08,170
OK that way the body has kind of a gray that light gray it looks a little better with the white card.

82
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,140
All right.

83
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,060
So now let's get down to our javascript's area.

84
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,250
Let's go down to here and let's say quick to do this.

85
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:28,160
So what do we want to do here we want to basically catch whatever we type into that input field so we

86
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,170
can actually get get us we can call a submit function on that form.

87
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:40,600
Now remember we gave the form an ID of to do dash forms.

88
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:49,520
So we're going to say to do form on submit then we want to run a function.

89
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:56,330
OK we want to pass an event parameter here because we want to stop the form from actually submitting

90
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,740
and we do that with the dog.

91
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,610
Prevent

92
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,370
default like that.

93
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,710
OK and we can just console Daut log and test.

94
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,380
So they will just say one two three.

95
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:18,850
So now if I go down if I open my console with 12 click on the console tab put something in here and

96
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,250
hit enter or we see one two three.

97
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,440
OK.

98
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,520
Next thing we want to do is basically build our output.

99
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,690
OK now we can get whatever we type in this with Jay Querrey.

100
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,940
So if I do.

101
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:44,710
Jay queery I remember that input we gave it a class or do we know we gave it an ID of to do so we could

102
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,360
say to do.

103
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,700
J.A.G. to do it.

104
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,530
VAL.

105
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,110
And that'll give us the actual value.

106
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:58,790
So if I type in hello and I hit Enter it's not going to work.

107
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:06,560
Oh I forgot the hash the id to do now if I do.

108
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,180
Hello enter we get hello down here.

109
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:16,410
So we basically just want to build up our dorm so that we can put whatever we have here into this list.

110
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:22,970
OK so the way that we're going to do that is by creating a variable called to do or not to do output

111
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:31,170
and I'm using Consta musing S6 and tax and then I'm also going to use a template literals so we can

112
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,250
use back ticks.

113
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,750
These are not quotes.

114
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,990
These are back ticks to the left of your number one key same key as the till day.

115
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,260
And then in here we're going to build out our list item.

116
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,020
OK and it should look just like this.

117
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:56,310
OK like one of these to do so I'm just going to copy this one of those allies and put that within these

118
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:03,990
back ticks OK now we don't want to do one as the actual to do we want what I just showed you now when

119
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:12,280
you used template literals which are what these are called these these tactics we can use this syntax

120
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,920
whips to put in a variable.

121
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,850
Now in this variable I mean this could be any expression actually we're going to use J Querrey So we're

122
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:27,990
going to say Jay Querrey ID to do and we want the value the value.

123
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,320
So we want to go like that and that'll put whatever the value is there.

124
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,030
OK.

125
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:38,070
Now up until this point it's just putting all this in a variable it's not going to output it yet.

126
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:50,490
So what we want to do is we want to take the two Doo's class which is to see what is it right here.

127
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,200
So to do as class is actually the UL.

128
00:10:53,310 --> 00:11:00,140
And we want to append our new to do into this and we can do that with the J Kuri method append.

129
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:06,250
So that's what we'll do we'll go ahead and write under the variable.

130
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:15,740
We'll say bring this back we'll say class to Dewes which is the UL.

131
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,930
And then we want to append into it.

132
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,590
Our output variable which is the new ally.

133
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,040
OK hopefully that makes sense.

134
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,630
And then finally we'll just have a materialized toast that says that the two had been added

135
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,780
and we can do that like this.

136
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:42,620
I will say to do added and three seconds.

137
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,800
All right so let's save that and give it a shot.

138
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:52,500
So I'll say test and enter and then we go to do at it and it gets added down here.

139
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,040
Now we want to do is we want to be able to delete these.

140
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,960
So we want to be able to click on these axes and have them delete.

141
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,580
Now since there's multiple X's we're going to be using the class to delete.

142
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,740
And there's multiple ones of those.

143
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,290
So we have to use what's called event delegation.

144
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:19,180
So we're not going to call the actual event on the delete class we needed to call it on a parent of

145
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,750
it.

146
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,160
So I'm going to use the to do as you well.

147
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:29,800
So we'll go down here and let's say delete to do's.

148
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,910
So I'm going to take that well which has a class of to.

149
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:41,790
And instead of doing a dot click we want to do a dot on click.

150
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,810
This is how we can do event delegation.

151
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:53,980
So dot on click and then we want to get the daily class OK which is if we look up here each of these

152
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,830
tags around the icon they have a delete class.

153
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,660
OK so that's what we're targeting.

154
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,910
Now we want to do is pass in a function for when we click on to delete.

155
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,050
OK.

156
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:17,650
And this is going to take in about an event parameter and then we're going to prevent the default

157
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:29,640
and then to to actually remove We want to take this meaning whatever one we click.

158
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,810
We can use this and then we can do Daut remove.

159
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,410
OK.

160
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:42,110
Now when we click on a delete it's the actual tag that we're clicking here so if I do this don't remove

161
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,970
it's going to remove just the tag.

162
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,770
Let's let's see what that does.

163
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:53,010
All right so if I click it it just it just removes the X which obviously isn't what we want.

164
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:59,490
So we want to go this Daut parent which moves to the next level up.

165
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,840
All right now the next level up from the tag is the div..

166
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,440
OK because we have a div.

167
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,030
That's not what we want to remove.

168
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,320
Either we want to move the ally which is another level up.

169
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,460
So we want to do dot parent dot parent dot remove.

170
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,610
And that should do it.

171
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:28,410
OK and then we'll do our materialized toast like that and we'll just say to do removed and save.

172
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:36,620
And now if we go down and click the X it goes away we get to do removed we can add it to do and then

173
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,420
delete it.

174
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,620
All right so that functionality is done.

175
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,900
So now let's just add a simple footer.

176
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,130
Real quick before we end this video.

177
00:14:47,290 --> 00:15:00,910
So under the section we're going to do for her will be for our dog S. dot blue dot Darkon dash too and

178
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:07,450
we want to do white text and we want to center it.

179
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:16,420
OK and we're just going to put a paragraph we're going to say Mad Men panel copyrights and then we'll

180
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:22,850
do ampersand copy 20 18.

181
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,390
And there you go.

182
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:30,670
All right so in the next video we're going to do is add our little floating button here so that we can

183
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,990
add posts.

184
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,450
It'll take us to the post categories and user page things like that.

185
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,210
I'm sorry not the page is going to open up a modal for each one.

186
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,040
OK so we'll get to that next.
