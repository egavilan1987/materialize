1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:06,420
All right guys we're almost done with the dashboard part of this theme so we need to add our floating

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:13,130
button down here to add the post users in categories and that's all going to happen through modals.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,450
So let's first create the button so I'm going to go right under the flooder that we created in the last

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:25,650
video and let's say fixed action button and we're going to give these.

5
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:34,800
It's going to be a div with the class of fixed action dash PTEN and then we want in a tag with the class

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,690
of beat and floating which will put it down in the corner.

7
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,240
I'm also going to give it a class of between large which will make it bigger and then a class of red

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,510
which will obviously make it red.

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,980
OK we don't even try here.

10
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:59,080
And then inside the tag I want the plus icon.

11
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,530
So we're going to do I don't.

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,020
Material dash icons.

13
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,570
And in here we're going to say add.

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,940
Ok so if we save that you see now we have our little plus icon it's going to stay in that position no

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,340
matter what.

16
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:19,470
Now I don't want to actually push this for anything I want to hover over it and then have the other

17
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,950
buttons pop up above it to add a post a user or a category.

18
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:30,820
So to do that just like we did in the sandbox we go right under the Atallah and put a UL.

19
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:41,930
OK and in this you will have an ally and then we'll have an eight tag with a class of DTN dash floating.

20
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,680
It's also given a class of blue.

21
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,570
All right.

22
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,940
Now this is actually going to trigger a modals so I'm going to put a hash and then say post dash motile

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,370
and remember any button or link that triggers a modal also needs a class of modal dash trigger.

24
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,950
OK so that's a must.

25
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,100
And then inside here we're just going to have another icon.

26
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:13,620
So we'll say material icons and we're going to use a mode underscore at it because that gives us a pencil

27
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,460
icon.

28
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,550
So if we save that and I can see as a hover over it we get the pencil icon.

29
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,930
All right.

30
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:27,580
Now let's create the other one so I'm going to copy this list item and we're going to do two more.

31
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,830
OK.

32
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,240
The second one is going to trigger the category modal.

33
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:41,200
So we're going to change this to category motile and we're going to also change the icon from Mode edit

34
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,710
to folder figure folder is a good image for a category.

35
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,100
All right.

36
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,260
And then this last one here is going to be it's going to trigger the user mode.

37
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:58,670
And for the icon we're going to use the strange supervisor account icon.

38
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:05,490
So supervisor dash sorry sorry underscore account.

39
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:11,460
So if we save that now we hover over it now we have our three different icons and each one will trigger

40
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,420
the modem.

41
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,580
All right so let's start off by creating the post motile.

42
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,920
Now all the models are going to go at the bottom they're actually going to go under the free loader

43
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,440
actually do it above the freeloader.

44
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:35,470
So right here we'll do post motile or it's actually the ad post moto.

45
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,450
So we're going to do a div with the idea of post motile because that's what we pointed to.

46
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,210
I'm also going to give it a class of motile.

47
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:45,610
All right.

48
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,090
And then here we're going to do our mobile content.

49
00:03:50,990 --> 00:04:02,150
So we'll have an H for will just say add post and then we're going to have a form with no action.

50
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,730
And inside the form will have our input field.

51
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:06,700
OK.

52
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:13,670
So that in the input field will have an input and we're going to give us an idea of title say the post

53
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:21,280
is going to have a title and then a label for title and then the text will say title.

54
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,220
All right.

55
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:29,510
Now we're also going to have a select list for categories so this will also go into a div with the class

56
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,550
of input field.

57
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:40,240
And then here we're going to say select We don't need an ID and a name so we can get rid of that.

58
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,260
And inside here we're going to do our first option which is going to have no value it's going to be

59
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,720
disabled because it's basically just like a title and it's going to be selected and it's just going

60
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
to say select option.

61
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:53,660
OK.

62
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:02,440
And then for the rest of these we'll do our options I'm just going to do value 1 1 2 3 and 4.

63
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,620
And then for that that the option text will put the category name.

64
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:13,190
It doesn't really matter I mean these aren't hooked up to a back end or anything.

65
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,210
So we'll see a graphic design

66
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:29,900
and let's do and three will be let's say tech gadgets and then we'll do one more for and that will be

67
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,200
other.

68
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,140
OK.

69
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:38,110
And then we'll have a label underneath.

70
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,280
So label and this will just say

71
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,360
category.

72
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,260
All right and then under that div we'll have one more input field.

73
00:05:53,670 --> 00:06:03,820
And put field div and in here we'll have a text area which doesn't need.

74
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,150
Actually it is going to have a name and I'll show you why in a minute.

75
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:16,860
And then the ID we'll be Fati we don't need the calls and rows though.

76
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,220
OK.

77
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:25,460
So we have a text area now and materialize your text areas need to have a class of materialized textarea

78
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,550
in order to look good.

79
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,510
And I think that's it.

80
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:38,890
Let's go underneath and put a label and this will be body.

81
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,880
All right so now we want to do is go under the form and we're going to have a model for her.

82
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,670
So it's going to be a class with modal Forder.

83
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,210
And inside here we'll have an eight tag.

84
00:06:51,830 --> 00:07:03,710
And let's actually let's give this a class of modal Dasch action also modal Dasch closed that way it

85
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:13,700
closes when the button is pressed DTN to make it a button and then we also want blue and lets do white

86
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,800
dash text and then we'll just say submit.

87
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,570
All right so let's see what that looks like.

88
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:29,420
So if we go and we click on the pencil icon looks and it's not going to work yet because we didn't initialize

89
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:36,140
the Modals So let's go down to the javascript there actually it will do we'll go like right here

90
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:48,090
and we'll say Jay Querrey class motile is going to call Doughton modal.

91
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,010
All right let's see if that works.

92
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,070
And there we go and post.

93
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,800
Now we also need to initialize a select I forgot about that.

94
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,220
I think it's a little weird that we have to initialize it but I guess because of the cool effect it

95
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,760
gives.

96
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:15,300
So it's a select and then we want to do Daut material underscore select.

97
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,020
All right so now we can have our select option.

98
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,330
All right.

99
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:27,710
Now the post I want to use a wizzy Wigg editor we're going to use S.K. editor which is very easy to

100
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:34,370
implement if we search for S.K. editor CDN that way we don't even have to download the script.

101
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,160
All we have to do is simply put this in our file.

102
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:46,550
So I'm going to copy that and we're going to put that right above the canvas on the chart J ass script

103
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,840
and then all we have to do is whatever the name of our textedit are.

104
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,240
I put body for hours.

105
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,060
We have to just put this in.

106
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,780
So I'm going to copy this line here.

107
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:06,840
You can just type it if you're not on this page and let's go down and just put this at the bottom.

108
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:13,830
So we'll go under the delete here and paste that in and then change this to body because that's what

109
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:22,260
we used for the name and save and now hopefully if we go and we go to the post model there it is.

110
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,980
Now we have this text editor.

111
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,950
Awesome.

112
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,850
All right so the other models aren't as difficult.

113
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:36,260
So what I'm going to do is just copy the the ad post motile that we just created.

114
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:43,100
So again the copy that we're going to go underneath paste it and this is going to be the category ad

115
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:49,670
category modals So we're going to change this to category and we're going to change this.

116
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,650
And then all it's going to have is a title so we can get rid of this to select input field the body

117
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,180
get rid of all that we just need that one field and then that should do it.

118
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,150
So it's save.

119
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,960
And now if we go and we cooked the folder icon we get ad category.

120
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,220
All right so now let's do the user.

121
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:19,370
So for the user what I'm going to do is copy the category motile.

122
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,080
All right.

123
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,180
And we'll paste that in and we'll change this to user.

124
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,300
Change this to user mode.

125
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,830
I will say add user.

126
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,680
And then we're just going to have a few textfield So this will be the same name

127
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:55,800
so we got name and then we'll do e-mail password and confirm passwords so for fields so will change

128
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:07,340
just one to email type ID email the text email and for all right.

129
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,520
And then this stuff down here will be password

130
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,570
password.

131
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,860
I know this stuff is this is kind of tedious but I mean it has to be done.

132
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,170
All right.

133
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,090
And then this one here is going to be typed password

134
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,350
but the ID I'm going to do password to.

135
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:43,620
And then for the text let's say confirm password and change the four to password 2.

136
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,210
All right so we'll save that.

137
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,310
Let's take a look.

138
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:55,220
So if we go to the little user's icon add user name email password confirm password.

139
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,500
All right guys so that's it.

140
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,880
We're done with the dashboard which is the most difficult part of this project.

141
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,710
We have a little sidebar so things are looking pretty good.

142
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,390
We have some some user interactivity here.

143
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:14,030
So when the next video we're going to start on our resource pages we'll go ahead and create our post

144
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,240
pages and the categories and all that stuff.

145
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,540
All right.

146
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,340
So I will see you in the next lecture.
