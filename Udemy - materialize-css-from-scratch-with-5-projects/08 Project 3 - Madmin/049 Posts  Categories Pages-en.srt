1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,560
All right guys in the last video we went ahead and finished up the dashboard so everything here is working.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,890
We have our To Do lists that we can add stuff to.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,000
We have our chart.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,760
We have our free loader when we load that page.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,600
We have our little floating buttons with them with the Modals So now we're going to move on to the inner

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,550
pages.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,480
So let's start with the Post Page The Post's categories these are going to be pretty easy they're basically

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,020
just going to be tables.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,380
Same with the comments end users but there'll be a little more they'll be a little more markup in those

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,990
because we have to add the images and so on.

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,320
All right.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,140
So let's go ahead and add some new pages here.

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,080
So in addition to index each team our We're going to create posts not aged him at all and we might as

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:50,530
well just create the rest of the pages we need so it's two categories not that glorious but categories

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,400
daughter aged him.

16
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,970
Let's also do what else do we need here let's do users

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,470
let's do comments

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,010
and we're going to have a log in page to log in age aged him.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,300
And so that's I think that's it.

20
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,520
And that's it for now at least.

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,430
So let's close all these up except for posts.

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,940
That's what we want to work on.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,730
Now what I'm going to do is copy everything in the index each team I'll file just so we can have like

24
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,470
the things that are going to be repeated like the nav bar and all that stuff.

25
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,750
So we're going to paste that in.

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,390
OK.

27
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,360
And let's let's go down to the javascript thing get rid of some of the stuff that we don't need so I

28
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,390
want to keep the freeloader on every page so we're going to keep like this part where we hide the sections

29
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,660
where we have the time out where we fade in the sections and fade the loader out.

30
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:57,350
We need this for the side navigation and we need this for the modal selects.

31
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,680
Yeah we'll keep that count.

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,670
We don't need that.

33
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:07,240
We can get rid of it and once we do all this the post page is what we'll copy for the rest of the inner

34
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,120
pages.

35
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,280
OK we don't need to comment approving and deny.

36
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:17,210
We don't need the quick to do's get rid of that we don't need to delete to do's.

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,680
So that ends at c that ends right here.

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,800
We also don't need the actually know what we do need that because we're going to have the post motile

39
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,880
on this page so we'll keep that.

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,570
OK so that should be all we need for the javascript.

41
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,060
Now the chart.

42
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:42,290
J.S. we don't need that I can get rid of that we don't need the canvas J.S. script.

43
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,110
And we'll keep the rest.

44
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,090
OK so we're going to keep the preload.

45
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,250
I don't know why I'm starting from the bottom but that's what I'm doing.

46
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,080
So it's fine.

47
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,570
The user mode so we don't need what we do want to keep is the post motile.

48
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:04,790
So we can get rid of the user in the category but let's keep the post modal which is this one here.

49
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,130
All right.

50
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,190
And then the fixed action button we're going to be changing that up.

51
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,940
But we'll keep that for now the footer we're keeping.

52
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,670
And then all the sections we're going to get rid of.

53
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,580
So this is the the to do's and all that get rid of that.

54
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,930
Get rid of this one here which is the section.

55
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,760
Visitors will get rid of the top on the stats.

56
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:38,440
So up to this point and we'll delete k we obviously want to keep the nav bar and that should do it.

57
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,020
So it's safe.

58
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:47,350
And then we should be able to click on the post link and it loads the post page which basically just

59
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,020
has a folder on it and the floating button.

60
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,450
So let's change the active link in the nav bar.

61
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,080
Right now it's on the dashboard.

62
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,460
See right here we're going to take that.

63
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:06,230
We're going to put that on to the posts and save and that way the Post is now highlighted.

64
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:13,530
Now for the content let's go under the nav bar between the now and the footer.

65
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:19,220
And we're going to put a section here will say Section posts.

66
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:26,140
So it's do a section each team I'll tag with the class of section and we'll give it a class section

67
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,520
posts.

68
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:37,930
Let's make it gray gray background and we'll lighten it let's say light dash for we make it really light.

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,390
And then in here we'll have a container.

70
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,930
So this stuff is all the same we'll do a row let's do a full column full 12 columns so I'll say Dot

71
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:56,510
call DOT s 12 and then and here we're going to do a card let's do our card content

72
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:07,800
it inside here will have a title so the title will be a span with the class of card title and we'll

73
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,000
just say posts

74
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,480
and then we're going to put a table.

75
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:23,360
So what I'll do is copy from the index aged him how the table we have which is right here.

76
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:32,060
So this table I'm going to grab it and we're going to put it in here and let's save

77
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,940
all the details page that's what we need.

78
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,870
Let's create that

79
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,540
details start H.T. OK.

80
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:54,670
So there's our table now I also want to put the date created in here so let's do that.

81
00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:03,220
So in our table in our t h area let's go right below the category and let's say a date created.

82
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,210
OK and then for each one of these We're going to need a new t d.

83
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,990
Let's say January 1st 2018.

84
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:18,690
And I'm just going to copy that and put that in here.

85
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:26,830
But let's let's change this to January 2nd.

86
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,150
All right.

87
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,740
We'll go round here and paste that in.

88
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,980
I'll change that to January 3rd.

89
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,150
We should probably put a few more posts as well.

90
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:44,120
So let's copy this actual copy all three of these will make six posts.

91
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:49,920
So all of the t was inside the T body.

92
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:58,600
Copy those and just paste them in again and we'll change this to pose for and this one will be.

93
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,250
Post 5 and post 6.

94
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:15,340
Ok I will just change the date Opsahl say five six and seven and I'll change one of these categories

95
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:15,790
we'll say.

96
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:21,440
Tech gadgets still look more realistic So let's save that.

97
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,810
And there we go.

98
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,250
So there's our post page.

99
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,060
Now I want to put some pagination down here.

100
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,120
Obviously it's not real pagination but just just for the UI.

101
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:42,780
So we're going to go down let's go down under this div which is the card content we want to go under

102
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,370
the card content and we want to put in a card action.

103
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,610
OK.

104
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,710
So it's kind of like a flutter of the card.

105
00:07:52,980 --> 00:08:00,400
And this is where we're going to put our pagination so will say UL dot pagination.

106
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,250
Hopefully you guys using it.

107
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:10,830
And then this one is going to be this is going to have a class of disabled because this is going to

108
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,490
be basically the current page you're on.

109
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:23,640
And then inside there we're going to have a tag with the class of let's do blue text and it's not actually

110
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:31,110
going to go anywhere inside the tag we're going to have a chevron left icon.

111
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:42,610
So we'll say I doubt I thought material dash icons in here will do Chevron underscore laughed.

112
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:43,630
OK.

113
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:52,730
So if I were to save that I see now we have the little arrow icon which is disabled on the next list

114
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,640
item in our pagination is going to be the active one.

115
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,530
So let's say Ally Dortch will say active class.

116
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:08,270
It's also going to have a class of blue because it's going to have a background.

117
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,380
And let's also do Litan will do Leitung dash 2.

118
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:22,700
All right in here will have an 8 tag with the class of white dash text and none of these are going to

119
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,720
actually go anywhere.

120
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,080
But this is going to also.

121
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,060
This is going to have a one because it's basically the first page.

122
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,680
So if we take a look at that case we have the one and that's the active page.

123
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:45,690
And then what I'll do is just copy this or copy that down and we'll just remove the active from it so

124
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,810
word or move the active floor move.

125
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:57,690
Actually all of these blue and Litan But let's give it a Wavves effect class.

126
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:03,330
OK we'll change this to two and then we can copy this.

127
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,770
So we'll do like two three four and five.

128
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:17,790
So change these numbers up so this will be three four and five and see what that looks like.

129
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,640
All right so that the text is white we can't see it.

130
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,840
So we have to change these.

131
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:30,300
I'm going to do control d to select the next one next one and the next one and then change them all

132
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,350
to blue text

133
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,820
and then we go.

134
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,110
So now we just need our right Chevron.

135
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,770
So what I'll do is copy once.

136
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:53,680
Let's copy this ally right here and put that out here and change this to Chevron right

137
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,980
and I'm just going to take away the disabled class and I'm going to put on a Wavves effect.

138
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,940
I'll save that.

139
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,460
And there we go so there's our pagination when we click on it you see the little waves effect.

140
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,080
OK.

141
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,600
So that's it for the post.

142
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,450
Now the category's is basically going to be the same thing just different content so I'm going to copy

143
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,680
everything.

144
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,760
Go to our categories and paste it in.

145
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:31,350
Now here we actually don't need the S.K. editor.

146
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,760
We can get rid of that.

147
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,370
Oh we've got to do the motile on the post page.

148
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,810
So real quick let's go down.

149
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,810
We already have the actual modal right here.

150
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,370
We just want to edit the button instead of having all of these things pop up.

151
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,730
I just want to click the plus and that will open the modal.

152
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,530
So are you just going to get rid of the whole ul.

153
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:03,810
You know we'll get rid of all that and then we're going to go to the actual link right here and put

154
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:09,500
an H ref to the post.

155
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:15,170
Motile and remember we have to add a modal trigger as a class.

156
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:21,270
OK so if I save that now if I click the plus icon it opens up the molto.

157
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,480
OK so now we're done with that we can close that up.

158
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,990
Actually let's copy everything again because we want that same type of modal button.

159
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,610
So will copy from posts.

160
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,180
Paste in categories again get rid of the S.K. editor.

161
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,870
We also don't need to select

162
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,740
Let's see we can get rid of the script to the S.K. editor and

163
00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:00,540
we actually want the category modals so I'm going to copy from the index page the category motile which

164
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:08,990
is right here and we'll go and will replace the post motile on the categories page.

165
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,150
So paste that in.

166
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:18,990
All right and then the action button we're just going to change this to go to category modal right now

167
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,140
for the table.

168
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,370
Let's go up to the top of the table.

169
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:31,350
Actually first let's change the active class C and go right here.

170
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:38,700
So class active we want to take it off of post and put it on two categories and then we'll go back down

171
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:46,800
to the table and further categories it's basically just going to have a title and create date so we

172
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,580
can get rid of this category.

173
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:58,780
And what I'll do is just get rid of this TDD and now we can have that as the category name.

174
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,720
Same thing here.

175
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,600
Get rid of that.

176
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,680
Get rid of that for this one will say we got web development graphic design.

177
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:13,550
Let's do tech gadgets.

178
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,360
And then this last one is going to be other

179
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:20,970
other.

180
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,190
And then we can get rid of the rest of the teacher's

181
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,540
all right and we'll leave the pagination.

182
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,820
So let's save it.

183
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,390
Let's go to categories.

184
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:37,160
One thing I forgot was the title.

185
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,440
So where is it right here.

186
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:49,230
So we want to change this from posts to categories.

187
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,420
All right.

188
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,990
And if we click the button here that should open the category motile.

189
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,550
All right.

190
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,290
So we're going to go ahead and saw here guys in the next video we're going to do the comments in the

191
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,380
user's page.
