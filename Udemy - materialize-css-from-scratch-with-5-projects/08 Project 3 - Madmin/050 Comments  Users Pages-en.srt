1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,590
All right so in the last video we did the post in categories in their pages.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,850
Now we're going to do the comments in users which are going to be very similar to posting categories

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,610
so I'm going to copy everything that's on the post page.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,120
I actually think a better idea would be to copy everything in the categories page.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:25,140
And one thing I forgot is in the categories age Tamal I just want to change this to categories as well

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,950
as this class name should be section categories.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,360
So we'll save that and then we'll just copy everything here and then let's go to our comments each time

8
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,390
and paste that in.

9
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:39,680
All right.

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:49,650
We're going to go to the top and change the active class from categories change that to comments

11
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:53,690
OK.

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,580
That will go down.

13
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,500
Change just to comments

14
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,230
and section comments in the title

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,040
and as far as the content here we're going to have the image of the person that that created the comment.

16
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:24,460
So we're actually not going to have we're not going to have a T head area so we can we're going to get

17
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,590
rid of that.

18
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:31,690
We're just going to have the T body in then what I'll do is leave just one table row and get rid of

19
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,980
the rest.

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,920
So down to here.

21
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:41,120
So now we just have one table we're all in this first T.D..

22
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:49,050
His first column is going to be the user image but I'm going to set a width here of 70.

23
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:49,730
OK.

24
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:55,010
I wanted to be a certain size and then we'll put in an image tag and we're going to give it a class

25
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,100
of responsive dash.

26
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,650
I m g as well as a class of circle.

27
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:02,540
OK.

28
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,320
Now this source is going to be I m g slash.

29
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,720
Person one dot j peg.

30
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,280
OK reusing the same images.

31
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:20,450
And let's see I think that's actually we're going to add some inline style as well because I want it

32
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:26,380
to be pushed over a little bit in the size I want to set the width to 40 pixels.

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,800
So with 40 pixels and then margin left will add some margin to the left lets say 10 pixels

34
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,340
OK and then the next t d is going to be the comment.

35
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,530
So I'm just going to do like 10 words will say larm 10 tab

36
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:58,800
and let's see the next he is going to be a check a check icon and a close are an X icon wrapped in the

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,040
link so the link for this one let's give it a class of green text.

38
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:12,100
It's not going to actually do anything if you want to add the TOSed functionality like we did on the

39
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,080
dashboard you can do that if you want in here will have an icon

40
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,660
that should be a dash

41
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,000
and then this is going to be done.

42
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,440
And then what we will do is copy this.

43
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:46,190
And then this next one is going to have a class of red text and the icon will be close.

44
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,940
OK.

45
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,880
So it's copy let's save that.

46
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,960
And then let's go to comments and there we go.

47
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,670
So there we have one roll let's copy this.

48
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,740
TR The whole thing is.

49
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:05,660
Copy that and we'll paste in three more and then we'll change up the images.

50
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:15,760
So we have person 1 person 2 3 and 4 and save.

51
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:16,980
And there we go.

52
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,640
So there's our comments page.

53
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,920
All right so now we're going to move to the users.

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,100
Actually that's just finished.

55
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,880
Let's let's see if we have anything else.

56
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:33,770
We just want to get rid of the fixed action in the motile because there's no actual add comment functionality

57
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,100
so I'll save that.

58
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,730
All right so now let's copy categories again.

59
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,350
The whole thing.

60
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,540
And then let's go to users

61
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:59,160
and paste that in and go up to the top will change the active class from categories to users.

62
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,360
OK.

63
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:09,330
And then let's see down here we'll change this to users.

64
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,500
I know this can get tedious guys

65
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,320
change that's when it's the same way out and just different content.

66
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,000
It gets very tedious.

67
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,330
So let's see what do we want for users.

68
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,990
We're going to want the name.

69
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:35,130
Well we're going to want the image first of all so for the first th I'm going to leave it blank.

70
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:42,370
And then the next one will be the name and then the next one will be the e-mail.

71
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,660
And then let's do a register day

72
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,660
just say registered and the last one we're going to leave blank.

73
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:53,450
OK.

74
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,390
So then down here let's leave one table wrong get rid of the rest

75
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:10,500
and for the image what I'm going to do is copy from the comments table row that has the image because

76
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,320
it's going to be the same thing so I'm going to grab one of these TVs well grab person one actually

77
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,600
and then put that here for the first CD.

78
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,810
Actually I'll just get rid of all those so pace set in for the first TV.

79
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,600
Right.

80
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,020
And then the next one is going to be the name

81
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,230
Next on e-mail.

82
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,300
Then we have the registered day

83
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,490
and then we have the details link

84
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:03,020
between blue Lou Litan dash 2.

85
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:08,200
That's going to actually go to details dot H.

86
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,020
Hello.

87
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:19,470
All right so now what we'll do is copy the table row and let's do four users so two three four and then

88
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,060
we'll just change up the content.

89
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,550
So the second one is going to be person to

90
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:34,810
and for the name will say Larry waters.

91
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:44,060
Let's see e-mail b l quaters registration will see January 3rd.

92
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,330
All right.

93
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:55,730
Next one actually is going to be person three person three and then this will be let's say Susan Williams

94
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,780
Susan registered date.

95
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:20,920
And then this last one will be person for and this will be Jeff Burke say Jay Burke and January 10th.

96
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,670
All right now we're going to need a motel for this.

97
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:32,080
The user modals So let's let's change this rate here to use or modal and then change.

98
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,260
Actually we'll just get rid of this category motile and will copy the user one from the index

99
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,400
so I'll paste that there and then that should be good.

100
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,750
So let's save it.

101
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:56,570
Let's go to our users page and we forgot the text in the details button.

102
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,730
And this one.

103
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,420
All right.

104
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,410
So there we go there's our users of the image the name email registered date.

105
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,140
So that's good.

106
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,900
We click this button and we get the ad user.

107
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,420
All right.

108
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,920
So in the next video we're going to get to the logon page and possibly the details page you'll see if

109
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,490
we can get them both done in the same video if not we'll just split them up and then we should be done.

110
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:37,770
All right.

111
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:38,800
So I will see you in the next.
