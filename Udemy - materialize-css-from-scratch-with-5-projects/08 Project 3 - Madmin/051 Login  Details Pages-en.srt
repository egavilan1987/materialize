1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:06,300
All right guys so now we just have to do the log in page and the details page so we're going to start

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,480
with the log in.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,510
Now blogging is going to be quite different because we're just going to basically have a little box

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,400
in the middle with the log in form.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,160
We're not going to have all of the we are going to have now but we're not going to have all these lengths

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,260
it's basically just going to be the blue bar with the logo.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:31,110
So what I'll do is copy the post page and then go to our log in and paste it in and we can actually

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:43,320
get rid of the Get rid of this select the all the side now because we're not going to need that.

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,730
And then we'll leave the pre-load our stuff we can get rid of the S.K. editor script we can get rid

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:01:01,830
of the modal we can get rid of the fixed action button we'll leave the footer and let's get rid of all

11
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:07,470
the sections so up to the Nav..

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:07,890
All right.

13
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,720
Now the Nav. is going to be very simple actually we can do it we can just recreate the now because it's

14
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:20,670
going to be so simple so just get rid of the whole Nav. and let's remake it so we'll just say Nav. with

15
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:32,320
the class of blue and dark and two container and now wrapper

16
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:45,780
and a tag with the class of brand dash logo and you'll have a go to index each table.

17
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,990
And then here we'll put madmen and that's it.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,900
That's our now varlets save it.

19
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,110
Now we go east we click log out.

20
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,140
It should take us to the log in page.

21
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,300
Good.

22
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,840
So from here under the nav we're going to put the log in.

23
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,140
All right.

24
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,030
Now I'm going to wrap it in a container

25
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,480
and let's do a row.

26
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,370
Actually you know what.

27
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,740
Let's let's let's wrap this in a section.

28
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:31,070
I wasn't initially going to but I think it's a good idea to do it so we'll say S.S. and then Section

29
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:40,280
loggin and then we'll just take this and we'll go ahead and move that up.

30
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:40,650
OK.

31
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,800
So inside the row we're going to have a couple of classes.

32
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,110
So we're going to do call s 12.

33
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,950
So it's stacked on mobile devices 8.

34
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,530
So eight columns on medium but also an offset on medium screens.

35
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,620
We want to offset it to one large screens.

36
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,720
We wanted to take up six columns and we want to offset it

37
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,220
3 so offset dash L3.

38
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,710
Okay and that's going to change the width of the box depending on the size of the browser.

39
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,320
So if we were to save that we're not going to see anything yet.

40
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:27,180
But inside here let's put a card panel.

41
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:38,030
I'm also going to give it a class of log in and I'm going to give it a class of blue Darkon to white

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,480
text and center.

43
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,230
So there it is.

44
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:54,180
So depending on the with ex-CEO it gets bigger and smaller and bigger and you can mess around with it

45
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,420
if you want.

46
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,540
That's just what I what I feel looks the best.

47
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,400
So inside here we're going to put in h one and we're going to say madman.

48
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,370
Log in.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,280
Actually it's doing H-2 that's kind of big.

50
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,390
All right.

51
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,920
So underneath that we'll have our form and we're actually going to have the end the action go to index

52
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:27,080
start aged so that when you click when you submit it goes to the index page.

53
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,980
All right then we're going to have our input field.

54
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:39,350
So this is going to be the e-mail but I'm going to prefix it with an icon Silex to material icons female

55
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:49,150
and we need to give this a class of prefix since it's prefixing an input and k we'll say intuits let's

56
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:55,830
do type email and let's give in and I d e mail.

57
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,450
OK then we'll do our label for e-mail.

58
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:10,650
And then the text and save and then we go now the label I want to give that a class of white text.

59
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,940
So it's not so dark

60
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,930
where you go.

61
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,740
All right.

62
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:26,450
Now we also want the password fields so we're going to copy this whole input field div and paste that

63
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:31,450
in and we'll change this to the icon to lock.

64
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:43,760
Change all this stuff to password.

65
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,160
OK.

66
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:55,880
And then underneath this input field we're going to have our submit so we'll say we'll give it a type

67
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,630
of submit

68
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:11,810
and value we'll say log in let's do a couple of classes so we want to beat and beat and large Let's

69
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:21,490
do BATNA extended which is something that it's a custom class I'm going to create in let's do Gray.

70
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,640
OK.

71
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,060
Oh we want to also want to lighten it.

72
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,360
So we'll do Litan for and let's make sure it's black text.

73
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,890
Ok so we'll save that.

74
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,370
And I mean that looks OK but I want the button to actually stretch all the way across.

75
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:51,050
So what we'll do is go to our CSSA or main dot CSSA file and let's say Vitti and dash extended display

76
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,050
it as a block.

77
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:59,430
Let's give it a width of 80 percent margin.

78
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,760
Auto.

79
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,960
And let's move it from the top a little bit.

80
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,530
So margin top 20 pixels.

81
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,420
All right and I also want to move the whole log in box down a little.

82
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:22,020
So remember we gave it a class of log in let's say margin top 70 pixels and save outs to the sum to

83
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,930
the bottom two.

84
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,980
So margin bottom 70 pixels.

85
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,610
And there we go.

86
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,700
So there's our log in page.

87
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,360
So if I put something in here

88
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,850
and log in takes us to the dashboard.

89
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,850
Awesome.

90
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,420
So last thing we have to do is the details page so let's close up those.

91
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,890
Let's copy the post page again and then go to details and paste that in.

92
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,830
And basically the details page is like the post edit page it's where we're going to see the values for

93
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,080
the posts and all that.

94
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:07,350
So we're going to keep for instance the S.K. added or the Select it's going to have it's going to have

95
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,210
all the fields the motile has.

96
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,980
But in the page.

97
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,450
So let's

98
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:21,680
let's actually go to the top and let's get rid of the active class on the post.

99
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,470
We don't want an active class anywhere because this isn't actually in the Nav..

100
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,530
OK.

101
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,100
And then we're going to go down here to the section C section

102
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,340
details

103
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:47,190
and then get rid of the table.

104
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,240
OK.

105
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,300
In the card action.

106
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,840
I want to keep it I want to get rid of the pagination so delete the UL

107
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,190
all right and we can get rid of the fixed action button

108
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:11,400
and what I actually want to do is in the card content where we have the title I want to put a row where

109
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,040
I want this to be a grid.

110
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:21,000
If we're going to say dog call will stack these on small screens but I want it to be six columns on

111
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,160
medium and up.

112
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,330
So we want to add these.

113
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,670
And then we'll put the title in one

114
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:37,660
and then this one is actually going to have the who created it.

115
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,780
It's going to have their image so I'm going to copy that from the comments page right here.

116
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,380
But not just the image.

117
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,520
And we'll put that right here.

118
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,590
And then let's go under it and put a paragraph and we'll say.

119
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:01,080
Posted by John Doe.

120
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:11,010
And then another paragraph and we'll say on January 12th 2018 and then I'm going to give this column

121
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:19,470
a class of center as well so let's save that and then let's click on one of these details links and

122
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,860
then we go.

123
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:29,670
OK so underneath the row that we just created which ends right here is going to be basically the form

124
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,460
that we have in the motile.

125
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:38,780
So I'm going to go down to the post motile and copy the whole form.

126
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:45,500
Copy the form and then I'm going to get rid of the modal altogether.

127
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,290
K now the form will go right here under the road that we just created.

128
00:10:53,450 --> 00:11:00,320
And we're going to change or not change we're going to add value to the input here for the title

129
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,600
of toast one just to make it look more realistic.

130
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:17,100
And then let's see we'll go to the textarea and in here let's just say this is the content for post

131
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,000
want will save it.

132
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,180
All right so that looks good.

133
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,520
Now will do is create a save and delete button.

134
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,480
OK if they want to save it or delete it.

135
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:37,860
Actually for the select option let's put selected on one of these categories like that

136
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,200
and you see how the body is like right up against the OR that's the label I'm going to get rid of the

137
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,000
body label because that doesn't look right.

138
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,010
It's pretty obvious it's the body there.

139
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,750
And then let's see in the card action this is where we're going to put the button.

140
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:06,300
So let's say Vautin class beats and let's give it a class of green and we'll say save and then I'll

141
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,500
copy that down.

142
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:15,680
And then this one will be delete and we'll change it to read and there we go.

143
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,190
So those are details page.

144
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,880
All right pretty simple and I think that that's it.

145
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,880
All right so I think it's a pretty nice UI.

146
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,760
We even have some functionality but obviously if you wanted to move on and learn a back end language

147
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:40,820
or perhaps no J asked which is a runtime which is also a server side technology you could actually build

148
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,010
