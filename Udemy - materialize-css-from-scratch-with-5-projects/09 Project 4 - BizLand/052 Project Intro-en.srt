00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,350
Hey Guys welcome to your next project.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:07,720
So this is going to be a full screen landing page called biz land and we're going to go through and

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,010
Josh I'm going to show you some of the features that we have here.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,260
So if I reload the page you'll see that this text will fade in.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,980
That's because we're using the scroll fire component.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:22,480
We're also using scroll fire for the nav bar you'll see it's transparent and if I scroll down when we

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,600
hit a certain point it turns to solid That way we can't just see through it and you can read the text

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,280
clearly.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,970
OK and it's going to stay solid until you actually come back to the site at the top.

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,110
OK we're also using an overlay for the image.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,520
So it's kind of a bluish grayish purple ish overlay.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,570
We have scroll spy enabled so that when we click a link it takes us down to that area and just to go

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,230
over the areas real quick we have these colored boxes here with some icons.

14
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:57,310
We have the boat area with an image and a card with some extra shadow and inside the card we have a

15
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,560
collection.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,310
OK and then right here we have just some testimonials and some cards that we have our contact form with

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,730
a Google map behind it.

18
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:11,710
So we're going to implement Google Maps and then we just have a very simple Forder.

19
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:12,430
OK.

20
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,230
We also have this icon here just to notify the user that they can scroll down and if they click it it'll

21
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,800
take them down to the contact area.

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,840
OK let's go ahead and resize this and take a look at their responsiveness.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,200
So if we go down to here you see we have a sidebar with the branding at the top and these boxes now

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,890
turn to two six column divs and everything looks pretty good.

25
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:43,320
If we go smaller to smartphone size you'll see that the image actually moves up.

26
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,920
I didn't want to take the whole the whole area on very small screens.

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,370
I didn't think it looked right.

28
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,690
So that's that.

29
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,020
And then we just have everything that's stacked OK and it looks pretty good.

30
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,910
So that's what we'll be building guys hopefully you enjoy it.

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,250
And let's get started.
