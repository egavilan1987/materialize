1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,190
All right so we're going to get started on this project so we're going to do what we did in the rest

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,340
of the projects and create a new folder called biz land.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,590
And I just want to bring everything from the theme starter over to our new folder

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,410
Okay.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,180
And then let's put this up here and I'll go ahead and openness with the code.

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,000
Of course you can use whatever you like.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,290
And then the index age.

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,550
Tim I'm going to open with life server

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,980
right.

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,870
So now we just have our theme starter Let's pull this down a little bit

11
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:44,760
OK.

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:51,070
And now what we'll do is let's change the title here to biz land

13
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:02,070
theme and what we're going to do in this video is the whole land the whole image the showcase or head

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,680
or whatever you want to call it with the nav bar.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,600
So let's get rid of this H-1 here.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,010
Get rid of this too.

17
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:16,390
And inside the body let's put a header and let's give it a class of main header.

18
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:24,690
Now we want an overlay over the image so I'm going to put a div here with the class of primary dash

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,010
overlay.

20
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,800
That's just what I like to call my my overlays and then if we had another one with another color we'd

21
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,330
call it secondary overlay.

22
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,160
Now the nav bar is going to be fixed and remember if we want a fixed nav bar that is going to kind of

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,330
scroll down with us.

24
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:48,150
It needs to be wrapped in a div with the class of nav bar fixed and then inside here we put our NAV.

25
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:54,450
OK and this is going to have a class of transparent because I don't want it to have any background.

26
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:03,270
So it's put a container in our nav bar and then we'll put our class of Nav. wrapper.

27
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,260
You guys should start to remember these classes you know because we're using them in just about every

28
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:17,050
project and then we want our branding So it's going to be in a tag with brand logo.

29
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,330
We'll have a go to home.

30
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:26,700
And then let's just put in here for the text we'll just say biz land and then we want our button collapse

31
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,790
so it'll be in a tag with the class of button Dasch collapse.

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:44,250
And it's also going to have another attribute of data Dasch activates and we'll call this mobile dash

33
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,500
now.

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:55,910
OK and then inside here we want an icon with the class of material dash icons and we want the menu icon.

35
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,830
So if I save that we're just going to get a transparent nav bar so far.

36
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,310
All right.

37
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:12,780
Now underneath the button collapse we're going to put the the UL which will have a class of right because

38
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:21,300
we want all the links to float to the right and it's also going to have a class of hide on MGD and down

39
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,280
we want it to hide on medium size screens and less.

40
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,040
OK in here we'll have an ally.

41
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:38,580
Let's put our links here so this will actually know Class C it's going to go to hash home.

42
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,000
And then what I'm going to do is copy this ally.

43
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:52,260
So we want let's see let's do two three four and five of these.

44
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,970
So this one will be about

45
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,310
the Swan will be testimonials

46
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,980
and let's see this one here will be contact

47
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,740
and then this last one is actually going to be a bottom.

48
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,730
So it's not going to go anywhere.

49
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:28,240
It's just for show it's the download button so it'll have a class of the T.N..

50
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,060
And let's give it a class of blue and it'll say download.

51
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,960
All right.

52
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,140
So save that now for the side.

53
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:45,300
Now remember if it's a fixed nav bar the UL for the side now has to go under this div or it's not going

54
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:45,890
to work.

55
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:52,290
We won't be able to click on it so this div ends right here so we're going go right under it and let's

56
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,210
say side now those.

57
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:06,260
So that will be a UL with the class side nav and also an ID of mobile now because that's what we used

58
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,500
above.

59
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:16,800
And then and here what I want to do is put in H for the class of blue dash gray.

60
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,340
And let's also do Darkon dash 3 and let's center.

61
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,120
And that's just going to say biz land.

62
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,360
And then under that we'll have our links which are going to be the son going to copy all of these except

63
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,410
for the download button and put those inside here under the age 4.

64
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,390
They actually want to put a divider between the two.

65
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:48,820
So right here let's put in Ally and then an A with the tag of a class of divider.

66
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,980
It doesn't actually need a try.

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,030
Now in order for the sidebar to work we have to initialize it.

68
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:09,380
So let's go down here and let's say class foughten collapse and we want to call dark side now like that.

69
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:18,600
You know we'll say a knit side now of right.

70
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,280
So now we're going to do is work on the main image the background of all of this.

71
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,150
So you can go into your project files and you can get the images.

72
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:34,170
So I'm going to open up my land folder go to I am g and I'm going to paste in the two images that are

73
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,000
included.

74
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,730
So pay in and just to take a look.

75
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:45,770
So we have the showcase j peg and then we have the people j peg those are the two images for this project.

76
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:53,190
And then what we'll do is go to our main CSSA and we're going to add the CSSA for the header to have

77
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,670
the the image background and all that as well as the primary overlay.

78
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,150
So let's do the main header first.

79
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:08,230
So it's going to have a background which is going to be a u r l.

80
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:14,610
We're going to go outside of the CSSA folder into the image folder and then we want showcase dot chave

81
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:23,830
peg and then under that we're going to do a background size and set that to cover.

82
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:33,160
Let's do a background position and let's get that to center we want to center the image and we want

83
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,080
to do the height.

84
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,330
Now for the high we're going to use the H or viewport heights.

85
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,480
And what you can do is you can think of the height as 100 different slices.

86
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,180
OK.

87
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,250
And we can say how many of those slices we want.

88
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:54,760
Now those slices aren't going to change no matter how much how big or small the browser is it'll always

89
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,110
take up that amount.

90
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:01,780
So this is how we can do a full screen landing page and have it always be full screen no matter the

91
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,320
size.

92
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,380
So I want to say one hundred VH.

93
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,060
All right.

94
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,080
I'm going to set a minimum height of 600 pixels.

95
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,640
I don't want it to be able to go under 600 pixels.

96
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:22,700
And then we'll set the text to white and let's say at the position to relative because we're going to

97
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:28,550
have the overlay inside of it which is going to be absolute and anything absolute has to be inside of

98
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,740
a relative position element elements so will save and you can see it takes up the whole screen.

99
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:40,240
Now if I did like 50 VH It would take up 50 of the 100 slices.

100
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,780
So VHS is very very powerful.

101
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,290
We also have VW which is viewport with.

102
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,920
You can do the same thing going horizontal.

103
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,240
So now the image is too prominent.

104
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,010
We want to kind of dark it down a little bit with the primary overlay.

105
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:06,040
So it's sad that I'm actually going to put that up above.

106
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:06,640
All right.

107
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:14,270
So primary overlay will do the background and it has to be R-GA because we want it to be able to be

108
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,570
see through.

109
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:24,800
So the color will be the R.G. will be 63 red 57 green 77 blue.

110
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,840
And then for the Alpha for the opacity you will do 0.7.

111
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,440
OK we want to position it absolute

112
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:45,090
and then inside here inside we want it from the top zero position and the left zero position.

113
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:51,250
And we want it to spread across 100 percent and then also height should be 100 percent.

114
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,420
We wanted to take up the whole thing.

115
00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:00,220
The overlay should just do just that it should overlay the image so width and height should be 100 percent

116
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:06,880
and we'll set the overflow to hidden because we don't want any scroll bars or anything like that so

117
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,020
let's save.

118
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,400
And then we go now we have our overlay.

119
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,610
OK so let's add the content the showcase content.

120
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:26,030
So we're going to go see it's going to go under the UL right here still within this Div. say showcase.

121
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,640
So all of a classic showcase.

122
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,730
Let's also give it a container and inside here we'll have a row.

123
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:39,490
It's going to be a full column grid's So we're going to do call as 12.

124
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:47,890
And let's also do a custom class of main text and then in here will have an H 5 and it's going to say

125
00:10:47,890 --> 00:11:01,030
you found the can then H-1 and it's going to say right place to start.

126
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:07,640
Just some corny marketing text they came up with so we have a paragraph with flow text to make it bigger

127
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:14,210
and make it responsive and then it's going to say to take your business

128
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:23,000
to the next level with our services.

129
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:30,260
I can't spell and type services that have taken the companies

130
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:42,210
to the Fortune 500.

131
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,400
Probably misspelled something but that's mine doesn't matter.

132
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:51,730
So let's put a line break underneath and then we're going to have a button to learn more buttons so

133
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,980
it's going to be in a tag that's formatted as a button.

134
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,970
So be it.

135
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:06,220
And let's also do between large Let's make it white and let's make it have black text.

136
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:14,950
All right and then it's going to go to hash about and the text will just say learn more.

137
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,290
All right.

138
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,580
In addition to that button we want to have that icon as well.

139
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,310
That little icon to notify the user that they can scroll down.

140
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:31,250
That's going to be wrapped in a link with the class of white text and it's going to go to the contact

141
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,930
if they click it.

142
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:41,810
OK so now inside the tag what's put in Icon Tiriel icons.

143
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,650
We also want it to be medium sized.

144
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,420
And then the icon itself is going to be an arrow.

145
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:58,570
It's going to be erro underscore draw down underscore circle.

146
00:12:59,290 --> 00:12:59,660
All right.

147
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,010
I'm also going to give this icon a special class of scroll

148
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,100
dash icon because I need to grab on to it within the CSSA to position it.

149
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:11,560
OK.

150
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,650
So let's save and there we go.

151
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,710
Now we need to fix this up a little within the CSX.

152
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,770
So I want this all to be pushed down so let's grab the showcase.

153
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:34,030
So main Hetter showcase and we're going to add a padding top of 110 pixels so that'll push it down.

154
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:43,900
And then let's see we want to add the positioning for the scroll icon icon.

155
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,250
It's going to be positioned absolute.

156
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,680
Remember the header is already positioned relative.

157
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,280
So that's what we're using as a parent.

158
00:13:53,390 --> 00:14:01,490
We want to say from the bottom it should be 5 percent up and then from the left it should be 47 percent

159
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,510
over.

160
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,100
And let's set the opacity so that we can see through it a little bit.

161
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,980
So we'll set that to zero point five and save in there we go.

162
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,110
All right.

163
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,940
So I think that that's good for now.

164
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,130
So I will see you in the next lecture.
