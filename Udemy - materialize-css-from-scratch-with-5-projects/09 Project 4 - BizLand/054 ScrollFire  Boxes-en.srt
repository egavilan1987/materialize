1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,420
All right guys so in the last video we created the full screen Hetter here.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,460
Now what I want to do is before we move onto the boxes down here I want to implement the scroll fire

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:19,230
to kind of feed in this text when we enter and also make the nav bar solid when we scroll which we're

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,750
actually not really going to be able to test yet because there's no we have no scrolling.

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,890
Well I guess you could put a margin top or something.

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:38,220
But let's let's let's go down to and then each team will go down to the javascript area and let's see

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,110
we'll go right here and we'll say scroll fire.

8
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,740
So a scroll fire we need a variable.

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,480
Let's create our options which is going to be an array.

10
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:01,760
So first of all do the fade in of the text member I gave the text the class of main text.

11
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:09,720
So this is going to take a selector and it's going to be the class of main hash text and we're going

12
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,150
to set the offset to zero.

13
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,980
And let's say for a callback we'll have a function

14
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,900
that will take in the element

15
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,690
like that and then all we have to do is say materialize

16
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:45,630
materialized and then we're going to use fade in image and then pass in our money sign parentheses and

17
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,410
then the element.

18
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:54,570
OK now the offset just means that we want we don't want to scroll for it to fade and we just wanted

19
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,200
to fade in right away.

20
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:05,720
So then after the options array here we want to say materialize Daut scroll fire

21
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,880
and we want to pass in those options.

22
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,930
So let's save that and there we go.

23
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,140
So now when we reload it fades it

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,330
now for the nav bar.

25
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:34,640
All we have to do is add in another objects to these options and we can actually just copy this and

26
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,480
paste that in.

27
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,410
So now we're going to say selector and it's going to be the now bar fixed class.

28
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,440
So now our fix is in the offset.

29
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,170
I'm going to say fifteen hundred.

30
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,630
OK so when we get to that position this is that's when this will run and what we want to do is we can

31
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,460
get rid of this.

32
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,850
We actually don't even need to pass in this element here.

33
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,390
We're going to take the Nav. using Jay queery.

34
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:13,610
We're going to take the now and we're going to remove the class of transparent

35
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,660
OK not only do we want to do that but we want to add a class.

36
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,790
I guess we could just chain it on like this.

37
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:38,000
So I say add class of blue gray and also Darkon dash 3 or whatever color you want it to be.

38
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,670
So if we save that we're not going to see any difference yet because it has to hit this point before

39
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,690
this actually takes effect.

40
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:53,050
But what I could do to test it out is go to the each team now and go right here and let's just put a

41
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,450
div and we'll put a style

42
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,560
and let's say height equals

43
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,410
weight angle to do height.

44
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,030
He calls

45
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:21,700
say 700 when a scene equals C Ss.

46
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,160
OK so save that.

47
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,810
And then

48
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,140
seven hundred pixels.

49
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,490
OK so now if I scroll down

50
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,090
and work

51
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,780
it's to sixteen hundred

52
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,180
that's not working either.

53
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,320
So Nav.

54
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:04,530
remove class add class.

55
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,360
Know let's see if this is actually firing off.

56
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:17,880
I'm going to say materialize Daut toast.

57
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,490
Let's try that.

58
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,450
So a reload.

59
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,710
Scroll down.

60
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,010
All right.

61
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,660
So we're getting the toast.

62
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,660
It's just this isn't working.

63
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:32,160
I haven't used J-curve in quite a while so maybe we can't do that.

64
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,490
Let's try that.

65
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,620
Get rid of that toast.

66
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,860
That didn't work either.

67
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,610
What did I do wrong.

68
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,680
Oh I don't have coats in here.

69
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,460
Quotes.

70
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,020
There we go.

71
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,380
All right so that's working good.

72
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,140
So I'm going to just get rid of that this Stiv right here.

73
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,920
That was just for testing.

74
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,190
All right.

75
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,610
So we know that those two features are now working.

76
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,110
So let's create the boxes.

77
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:26,900
Now we're going to go under the header and we'll say Section boxes.

78
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,470
So it's going to be a section.

79
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,130
I will give it a class of Section dash boxes.

80
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:41,140
Notice I'm not giving it a regular section class because I don't want any padding I wanted I wanted

81
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,290
to be basically full with I wanted to take up everything.

82
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,220
I do want to add a class of center though.

83
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:48,540
What's

84
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,480
right.

85
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,780
And then inside here let's put a row.

86
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:04,150
OK we're going to use a grid we're going to say call let's do call x 12.

87
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,990
And then on medium screens it'll be six.

88
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,650
And on large screens it will be three.

89
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:21,540
And let's make this one blue with white text and we're going to give it a class of box as well.

90
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,460
And inside here we're going to have an icon.

91
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:33,530
So it's saying material dash icons are going to be medium sized And this or this one's going to be show

92
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,620
under score card.

93
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,730
OK.

94
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,930
And then age four we're going to say grow your business.

95
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,610
And then a paragraph and let's do Lorem 15

96
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,470
actually would sue Lorem Tony

97
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,400
hers.

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:10,130
So if I copy the column that's right here let's put in for three more so we have one two three four.

99
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,280
And then we're just going to change some stuff up.

100
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,560
So the second one I want to be purple something to change the color.

101
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:30,300
We're going to change the icon to people and then we'll change the heading to professional advisors.

102
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,670
And let's see this one here.

103
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:50,260
I'm going to change the color to teal so I'll say teal will change the icon to varified underscore user.

104
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:58,000
And then the H for is going to say six here your company.

105
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,830
All right.

106
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,010
And then finally the last one no change from blue to Amber.

107
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:14,010
Let's also do dark and for all make it darker and then the icon will be a count underscore balance and

108
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,100
then the H four is going to say

109
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:24,400
multiply your income so let's save that.

110
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,440
And that's what it looks like.

111
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,040
Let's see.

112
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,380
Why is that.

113
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:36,110
Icon not showing our show chart not card.

114
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,310
OK.

115
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,510
So there we go.

116
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:45,830
Now what I'm going to do is go to we're going to go to CSSA because I don't I want to add a bunch of

117
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:57,650
padding here so in the CSX let's add a class of box let's say padding 40 pixels on the top and bottom

118
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:03,380
10 pixels on the left and right and I'm going to add an important flag so that we make sure that that

119
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,410
gets overwritten and then the H for in the box.

120
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:20,300
I just want to add padding bottom of 30 pixels so save that and take a look and that looks pretty good.

121
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:30,340
And if we resize this when we get here we get them side by side and then here we get them stacked.

122
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:38,630
All right now let's work on the media query because somehow when this is very small like that I don't

123
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:42,280
want this to take up this whole area that's just too much.

124
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,660
So let's create a media query.

125
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,100
Yeah I will say media.

126
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:07,200
And then let's say men with I'm sorry Max width of 600 pixels.

127
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,130
Then we want the main header

128
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:20,160
We want the height to only take up 50 VH remember it it takes up a hundred by the fall but now when

129
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,680
it's less than 600 I'll save that.

130
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,630
Now it's only 50 viewport Heights which is what I want.

131
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,280
All right.

132
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,630
Good.

133
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,850
And then another thing I want to do is just make sure that there is no more see how this margin below

134
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:43,220
these boxes we have the class of Section boxes.

135
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,120
I'm just going to grab on to that in the C Ss right here.

136
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,610
And we're going to say margin bottom zero.

137
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,160
Hey we're going to say that's important.

138
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,800
OK so that gets rid of that.

139
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:10,580
Oh what.

140
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,360
That should work.

141
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:12,880
So.

142
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,630
Oh you know what we didn't put Roe.

143
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,970
It should be the ROE because that's what the margins actually on.

144
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,500
All right so that's going to be it for this video guys in the next video we're going to start to work

145
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,100
our way down and we're going to do the about page the about section.
