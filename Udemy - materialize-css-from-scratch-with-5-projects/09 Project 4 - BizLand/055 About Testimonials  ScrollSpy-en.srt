1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,630
All right so we have our landing area here the header we have the boxes now we want to work on the About

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:14,860
section so we're going to go under the boxes section and let's say section about.

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:22,020
All right so for this I am going to use the section class and also create a custom class called Section

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,370
about.

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:30,610
Let's also make it gray and we will lighten it will say Litan 3.

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:45,090
And let's do Center OK let's see let's put a container inside here we'll have an H2 and we're going

7
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:53,880
to say about this land under the age 2 will have a paragraph of flow text.

8
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,870
GPP

9
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,270
and let's do Warum 20

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:16,840
and then under that div I'm sorry under that paragraph we're going to put a row and we're going to have

11
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:27,360
a column that will be stacked on small devices and then on medium screens and up will be six columns.

12
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,560
So we're going to want two of these.

13
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,670
And in the first one will be that image that people image.

14
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:45,410
So it's to image it's given a class of responsive dash I am g as well as circle and then the source

15
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:55,310
is going to be I am g slash people dot JP So if we save that and take a look.

16
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,870
OK that looks good on this side we want to have that.

17
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,280
It's going to be a collection.

18
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,740
And I want to give it some extra shadow.

19
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:13,740
So in this column let's say I want to move it down a little bit so I'm just going to use a B R here.

20
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:23,960
And actually what I wanted to do instead of doing six I wanted to do 5 and then offset it by 1 that

21
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,560
way it's not so close to the image it's pushed over a little bit.

22
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:37,640
So we'll offset it and then let's put a UL but the class of collection and also a class of with Hetter

23
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,610
not with but w i th header.

24
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:52,970
And then let's give it some extra shadow some extra depth so we'll say Z dash dash dash for OK and now

25
00:02:52,970 --> 00:03:03,210
in here we want our head so this one will be collection Dasch header and we'll putting h 5 in here and

26
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,920
we'll just say Services

27
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:07,930
OK.

28
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:21,530
And then the rest of these let's do ally collection item and we want to have a check icon.

29
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:25,530
So I'm going to do I material Icahn's

30
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,420
and let's align them to the left.

31
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,050
I'll give this a left class and it's going to be the check icon.

32
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,320
And then after that I'll say business

33
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:47,390
consultation so save that and then we go so let's add some other services.

34
00:03:47,470 --> 00:04:01,120
I'm going to copy this library here so will do two three four five six and under business consultation

35
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,700
let's add a service of financial analytics

36
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,770
OK.

37
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,990
So this one will be security

38
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,680
services

39
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:26,070
and let's do marketing say marketing and advertising

40
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,250
an Internet services

41
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,300
and counting.

42
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,650
All right.

43
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,020
So that looks pretty good.

44
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,930
So now let's do the testimonial area.

45
00:04:51,070 --> 00:05:01,610
So we'll go under this section.

46
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,510
So give us the class of section in Section

47
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,300
testimonials.

48
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,390
We're also going to give it a blue background.

49
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,550
Make sure it's white text and center

50
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:28,510
in our container put in H2 and we'll say what our clients say

51
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:39,720
let's put a row and then we're basically going to have three boxes so we want them to be on medium screens

52
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,150
and up we want them to be four columns wide.

53
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:50,290
So call as 12 am four and we're going to have a card.

54
00:05:50,340 --> 00:06:02,490
So we'll say a card class of card class of gray light and dash for let's do black text and let's give

55
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:08,770
these a Z depth as well so say Z dash depth dash four.

56
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,200
All right.

57
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,990
And then inside here we'll have our card content.

58
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,860
And then that's just going to be a paragraph.

59
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,180
I'm also going to put some some E-M tags some emphasis.

60
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,500
And then let's do Lorem 30 tab.

61
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,100
All right.

62
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:34,240
Now under the card content we're going to have a class of card action which is kind of like a footer.

63
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,420
And we're just going to put a name let's say John Doe

64
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,020
from ABC Inc.

65
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:56,480
All right so if we look at that should look like that's you know what let's do 20 words instead.

66
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,890
There we go.

67
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,180
All right.

68
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:07,270
So I'm going to copy now this whole column which ends right here so when can grab that and we're going

69
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,800
to have two more.

70
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:18,220
So the second one here I'm going to change all I'm going to change is the name right here the name the

71
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,980
company so we'll say Sharon Johnson from

72
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,610
I don't know x y z

73
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:36,090
and this one down here we'll say from one to three

74
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,170
say Wayne Jackson all right.

75
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,510
So those are testimonials.

76
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:49,880
All right.

77
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,670
Now I'm going to skip the contact area with the Google map.

78
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,580
For now we're going to do that in the next video.

79
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,240
But I just wanted to do the water and get that out of the way.

80
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:07,200
So let's go down here and I'll put a comment here that says section contact just as a placeholder.

81
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,650
And then right here we'll do our folder.

82
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,180
OK.

83
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,330
And the water I'm actually going to use the same format from materialize.

84
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:27,110
SS If we go to our foot or here just going to grab this just to kind of shorten things up and we'll

85
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,220
change a couple of things.

86
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,420
So for the color let's go to the top.

87
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:39,500
The footer tag here and say blue gray and we want to dark in one.

88
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:47,730
And then let's see in this was changed this to location.

89
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:55,140
I'm going to get rid of this white text class just in H5

90
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:09,350
and let's see we'll get rid of this and we'll put a paragraph that will say this land.

91
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:15,210
And then for the paragraph we'll just say 5 5 5 somewhere.

92
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,070
Dr.

93
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,740
Boston Mass and then age five we have our links.

94
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:28,720
So we might as well just copy our links from the Nav..

95
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,940
So I'll grab home about testimonials and contact.

96
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,360
We'll just grab those and put those here in the UL

97
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:42,900
like

98
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,560
you should do it.

99
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:54,820
And then down here this foot of copyright I'm going to add blue gray and then I'm going to do Darkon

100
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:09,640
for and then we'll just add here is land theme twenty eight 18.

101
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,770
You know we'll just do that.

102
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,610
All right.

103
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,510
Let's see.

104
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:24,810
So for this instead of more links I want this to be a back to top with an icon.

105
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:31,680
So we're going to put in I tag here the class of material icons.

106
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:42,560
And let's also add a class of left and the icon we want is going to be keyboard arrow up.

107
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:48,300
And then after that icon we're going to say back to talk.

108
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,820
All right let's save it see what it looks like.

109
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,180
Good.

110
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,370
The only problem is our links are blue.

111
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,470
So we just want to add a class to these lengths of white text.

112
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,680
Ok so grab that

113
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,120
right.

114
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,760
So it should look good.

115
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,680
There you go.

116
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,080
Now for the scrolls spy because right now we don't have those.

117
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,010
We don't have them to have it implemented so let's do that.

118
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:27,150
So these links they're going to go to hash home hash about and so on the hash home is actually going

119
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,390
to be the body.

120
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:37,140
So give that an idea of home and then we also want to add a class of scroll spies so that it gives it

121
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,690
that effect.

122
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:40,740
OK.

123
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,590
Next one will be the about which is right

124
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,910
here.

125
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:54,270
So this section will have an idea of about and we want to have a class of scrolls by.

126
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,840
OK contact we'll have one but we haven't done that yet.

127
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,970
Testimonials is another one.

128
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,140
And yeah I think that's it.

129
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:21,960
OK now we have to initialize scroll SWI So let's do that right here.

130
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:35,210
So I believe we just do class scrolls spy and then

131
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,750
skirl spot.

132
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:40,380
All right.

133
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,760
So let's try that about testimonials contacts not going to work yet.

134
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,160
Home works good.

135
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,940
All right so in the next video we're going to work on the contact form and we're going to implement

136
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,510
the Google map behind it.
