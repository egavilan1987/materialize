1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,940
All right guys are in this video we're going create the contact form and implement the Google map.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,370
So we're going to go right above the foot are we already put a comment here for the contact and we're

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:21,850
going to use a section tag with the section class and also section Dasch contact.

4
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,770
And let's also do Center and let's do scroll spy.

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:35,110
Now this also needs an idea since it's going to be using scroll spy and say eye contact.

6
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,660
Now inside here we need to place a did for the Google Maps I'm going to create a div with an ID of Google

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,640
Maps.

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,180
OK.

9
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,360
Nothing's going to go inside of it just that div there.

10
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:56,090
And then we'll continue on with our container and let's put a row.

11
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:03,310
Now what I want is the form to be six columns wide but I want it to be pushed over to the right.

12
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,900
So we need to set an offset.

13
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:14,130
So we're going to say call let's do as 12 and then and six but we also want to do an offset and six.

14
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,680
OK so six offset.

15
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,970
And then here we're going to put a card panel

16
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:32,410
and we're going to use a little bit of depth shadow so let's do the dash dash dash 5 and inside the

17
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:43,060
card panel will put in each form will see a contact us under the age for let's put input field.

18
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:53,850
And this is going to be the name so we'll say input is going to have type text ID name.

19
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,510
And let's do a placeholder of name.

20
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:07,120
Ok under that will have a label for name and now same name.

21
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:16,040
And then what I'll do is copy that input field div and we'll do two three four.

22
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:27,920
So the second one is going to be email.

23
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,130
So I will be email.

24
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:31,910
Will do.

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,740
Type email.

26
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,450
And then this next one is going to be the phone.

27
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,360
So let's say I did phone placeholder

28
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:52,760
phone number label will be phone name for attribute will also be.

29
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,650
All right and this last one here is actually going to be a text area so I'm going to replace input type

30
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:11,100
text with text area and member text areas need a special class of materialized dash textarea and then

31
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,210
it also needs an ending tag.

32
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,000
And then for the label will say message

33
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:26,210
message will change the placeholder and let's change the ideas while

34
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,080
and there we go.

35
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,220
All right finally we need our input.

36
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:48,360
Our submit button so that will be input type submit value will say submit give it a class of PTEN and

37
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,830
let's do blue dash gray and save.

38
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,950
And then there's our form.

39
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,030
So behind it is where the the Google map is going to go.

40
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,650
Now there's quite a bit of Javascript.

41
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:07,970
We're going to need to bring in we're also going to need to bring in the Google Maps API script.

42
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:15,290
So we're going to go down to our script tags go right below the materialize script and above our custom

43
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:15,950
script

44
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:30,160
and then the source is going to be HTP and it's going to be maps Daut Google API I's dot com slash and

45
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,990
maps slash API slash Jay ass.

46
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,490
So that'll bring in the the API for us.

47
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:37,840
All right.

48
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,960
Now there's quite a bit of Javascript that we need to write and I'm not going to explain every line

49
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,400
because this isn't a javascript course.

50
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,570
There's plenty of snippets you can find for Google Maps.

51
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,200
This is basically one of those.

52
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,770
So we're just going to type this so now we're going to have two variables.

53
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,810
One is going to be the position where we want our marker.

54
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,690
The other is going to be the center position.

55
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,830
Both are going to be around Boston Mass if you want to change that.

56
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,360
That's fine.

57
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,050
But it's going to be an array and it's going to have a latitude and longitude.

58
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:18,400
So the latitude is going to be 42 Daut thirty six thirty six 1 1 4 5.

59
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:29,060
And then the longitude is going to be negative 71 Daut 0 5 7 0 8 3.

60
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,590
So that's the position and then the center position

61
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:45,950
is going to be 42 Dortch 3 7 7 8 1 5.

62
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:54,920
And then it's going to be negative 70 Daut 90 1 1 3 3.

63
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,900
So those are positions.

64
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:03,590
Now we're going to create a function called show Google Maps

65
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,080
and we're going to create a variable here called the last launch.

66
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:26,130
So latitude longitude we're going to set it equal to a new Google dot maps dot lat long should be uppercase.

67
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,860
Believe me I like that.

68
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:38,610
And then in here we want to position zero so that's still the latitude that's going to be this number

69
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:51,050
right here the zero index of that array and then we also want the longitude which will be position 1.

70
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,300
OK let me just close this up so that's that.

71
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,020
And then we want the center left latitude and longitude.

72
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:07,620
So I'm actually going to just copy this line and then change this to center.

73
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:14,880
Lat launch and again we were going to do this Google maps at launch except we're going to do our center

74
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,810
position right.

75
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:30,870
OK so now that we have those Let's create a variable called Map options and set that to an object.

76
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:38,240
And and here we're going to set our options like our zoom level which I'm going to set to 12 street

77
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,470
so we can do strawe Street View control

78
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:52,910
we're going to set that to false we don't want the Street View control scale control.

79
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
We'll go ahead and said that true.

80
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:01,070
And you can look at the Google Maps API docs if you want to look at all this stuff.

81
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:10,700
Then we want the map type D and I want it to be a good road map type thing so we're going to say Google

82
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:22,770
dot maps dot map type Id just right here and it's going to be Daut road map like that.

83
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,760
And then the center position is going to be the center

84
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,970
launch.

85
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,180
OK so that's the options.

86
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:39,240
Now we have to actually create the map so we're going to have we're going to take that map variable

87
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:50,340
set it to new Google dot maps dot map and then we need to pass in where we want to put it.

88
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,100
Now remember we are that idea of Google Maps.

89
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,060
That's what we want.

90
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:02,880
So we're going to say document dog get element Friday and then Google Maps I think was a was it all

91
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,030
lowercase.

92
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:11,830
Oh so Id I guess just Google map.

93
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,470
That's what we want to use Google map.

94
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:16,920
All right.

95
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,700
And then we want another parameter with our map options.

96
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,940
So that'll create the map.

97
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,410
Now we want the marker

98
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,400
here seeking comment this stuff so this will be.

99
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,020
Will say create map

100
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:51,350
map options map positions.

101
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:51,710
All right.

102
00:09:51,720 --> 00:10:00,630
So show markers so we're going to say marker equals new Google Maps thought.

103
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,250
Marker

104
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,650
you know why it's usually these should be uppercase

105
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:16,460
K and this is going to take an object and we're going to say the position of the marker which is going

106
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,410
to be our last longe position.

107
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:19,770
Right.

108
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:29,190
And then the math is going to be our map variable and then we're going to say Dragon Ball you can make

109
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,480
your icon your markers drag a ball I'm going to say false for that.

110
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,890
And then animation

111
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:51,200
when it's set to Google Maps daunts animation Daut drop so we'll give that a little drop animation.

112
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,120
And then finally we need to add the event listener.

113
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:08,410
So the big Google Maps Daut the vente dots and then we're going to add the dorm Lisner

114
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,790
So Adam listener to the window

115
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,270
load.

116
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,880
And then we want to show Google Maps.

117
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,310
So now we need to do is add a little bit of CSSA make sure this is saved it's not going to show up yet

118
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:37,730
because it needs to be treated kind of like how this primary overlay is its position to absolute within

119
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,080
its container and then it's a 100 percent height and width.

120
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,420
We want it to take up the whole section contact.

121
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:58,350
So let's go to our CSSA and let's say Section contact because we need to set that to relative.

122
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,910
So that's a relative and then let's do our Google map.

123
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,990
We want to set the position to absolute.

124
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:26,330
We want to set the height to 100 percent with to 100 percent top 0 and left zero.

125
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,700
All right and let's set the z index to 0 as well Z indexes.

126
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,180
Basically how close it is to you to the screen.

127
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,600
The higher it is the closer to you it is.

128
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:46,610
So let's save that and still doesn't seem to be working on this.

129
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,470
Oh there we go.

130
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,390
All right so we have them out now.

131
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:58,070
Notice that the pin and the card panel here has it's not showing because we need to basically up the

132
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,750
in the z index of that.

133
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,420
So let's go right here and let's say Section

134
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,640
contact

135
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:16,040
card panel and we're going to position that relative.

136
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:21,670
And then we're going to set the z index to 1 and save.

137
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:28,060
So what that did is it moved it above the map because the map has a z index of 0 and you can see we

138
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,450
have a little marker here as well.

139
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,830
And we can move this around to.

140
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,590
All right.

141
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,640
So that looks pretty good.

142
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,870
So I think that's going to do it for this project guys.

143
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,660
Hopefully you enjoyed this.

144
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,320
And that's it.

145
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,650
All right.

146
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,510
So I will see you in the next one.
