00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:06,550
Hey Guys welcome to your last project in this project we're going to build a graphic design portfolio.

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,460
It's a pretty simple site but we're going to do something different.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,050
We're going to be using SAS.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,170
OK if we go to the materialize get started right here.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,630
You'll see that we have the regular source which we've been using.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,210
And we also have the SAS files or SPSS files that we can use and we can actually change up different

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,380
variables like let's say the standard.

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,070
I don't know that the card shadow or something like that.

9
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:36,520
You can you can manipulate that and change it to your liking.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,470
So I want to show you how to implement SAS and also how to create some variables where we can change

11
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,410
like the background color and stuff really easily.

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:44,770
All right.

13
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:50,110
Now we'll also be using scroll fire to have a fade in effect on scroll.

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,780
So notice that we see one project here if I scroll down a little.

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,380
Another one will appear.

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,380
Keep scrolling.

17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,450
Another one will appear so a lot of people asked me how to get that effect and they don't realize that

18
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,970
it's built in with materialize with scroll fire.

19
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:05,350
All right.

20
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:11,320
Now for each project we have a card we have some star ratings and we have the little button here and

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,080
this will actually open a motel with that image inside.

22
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,380
OK with some text and the title and the star rating.

23
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,950
And we have different pages this is abstract.

24
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,470
We also have logos which is basically the same thing it's just different images.

25
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,850
And then we have gaming which again is the same thing different images.

26
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,650
And we have our Sidebar over here and if we were to make this smaller.

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,650
What I did is I hid the text on a very small mobile size screens.

28
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,030
See the text there disappears and we just see the image and we can open up the motile and that looks

29
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,610
good.

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,790
OK so everything looks pretty nice.

31
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,760
It's very simple.

32
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,790
But again I wanted to do something different and use SAS.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,740
So in the next video what we'll do is get everything set up we're going to talk a little bit more about

34
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:07,210
SAS and we're going to install a program called Koala because we need our SAS to get compiled down to

35
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,630
regular CSSA.

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,460
And that's what we're going to use so we want to install that and get that set up.

37
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,160
All right so I'll see you in the next video.
