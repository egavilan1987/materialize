1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,410
All right guys who are going to go ahead and get set up here.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,750
But before we do I just wanted to talk a little bit about sace.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,730
We're not going to this isn't a SAS course.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,610
I just want to show you how to use it with materialized and all we're really going to be using is variables

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:21,420
in maybe a little bit investing a mix in we're going to create a mix in which is like a function but

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,860
you know if we want to create a variable we can use a money sign and then just name the variable and

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,020
we can set it to like a color or a font style anything in CSX.

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,430
And then we can simply use it wherever we want.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,740
OK so any selector and a style we can use the variable and we can nest styles so you can see where they're

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,520
putting a UL and ally and and a tag within the nav tag.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:53,900
So only these only the UL ally and tags that are inside a nav tag will be affected by these styles.

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,550
OK we can use Parshall's which are just separate C-s as CSSA files we can import them.

13
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:06,750
We can use mix ins which are like functions they can take in parameters and so on we can extend styles

14
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,490
or extend classes.

15
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,680
So it's really it's really cool.

16
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,430
We also have operators so we can have like dynamic functionality we can do conditionals things like

17
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,790
that but I'm not going to get too far into it.

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:26,130
I just want to show you how to get it set up and use it in a project now in order to use SAS the browser

19
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:34,090
doesn't actually read SAS or SPSS files it has to be compiled to CSSA to regular CSSA.

20
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,660
And we're going to use a program called Koala for that which is a GUI program it's a graphical program.

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,990
A lot of times you'll see people use command line programs from NPM and stuff but I don't want to get

22
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,510
into that I don't want to get too deep into it into the command line or I shouldn't say too deep I don't

23
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:58,650
want to get into it at all in this course because I'll tell you in my bootstrap course we used NPM we

24
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:08,070
used Gaulke to compile SAS and a kind of Olvir took the course all of the Q&amp;A questions if you go into

25
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,510
that course it's all about NPM and gulp and not bootstrap.

26
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,990
So I chose a different route with this course and chose not to do any of that because it just it just

27
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,290
distracted everybody from actual bootstrap.

28
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:22,620
All right.

29
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,180
So we're going to use a simple GUI program.

30
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,680
So let's go ahead and download this and install it.

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,540
So it's going it's going to download and basically all we do is at our project we can click the plus

32
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:42,590
sign at the project and we choose where we want to output our regular CSSA we choose this SPSS file

33
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,750
which is our SAS file and then where we want to output the standard VSS.

34
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:53,120
OK we also want to go to materialize and download the source for the SAS package.

35
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,650
So we're going to grab that as well while that's downloading.

36
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:05,120
Let's open up the koala's set up and depending on what's operating as operating system you're on it

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,840
may be a little different.

38
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,650
On Windows we're just going to go through this real quick.

39
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,090
Just click next.

40
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:18,230
I already had it installed so it's telling me I already have the folder but I'll just click yes and

41
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,370
install.

42
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,720
OK so it actually is already installed but that's fine I'll just go through it again.

43
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:30,780
All right.

44
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,940
So that's all finished.

45
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,210
Now we can go ahead and start it up.

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,210
Keep that shack thing click Finish

47
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,750
and it's going to start up our program so we don't have any projects yet.

48
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,870
I'm just going to leave this open for now.

49
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,600
So now what we'll do is create a new folder for our project and we're going to call this Gallup here

50
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,570
and what we'll do is take from the theme starter.

51
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,250
Initially I was going to do with a theme starter for the SAS but I'll just show you how to implement

52
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,200
it with this theme starter.

53
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,000
So we're going to copy our files over

54
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:20,000
and let's open up Gallup here with this code right now.

55
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:25,400
What I'm going to do is create to open up our folder here.

56
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,400
We're going to create a new folder called SPSS.

57
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,440
OK this is where all of our SAS is going to go.

58
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:38,660
Now the SAS is those are the files that we edit if you want to change anything in your CSSA you edit

59
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:46,010
your SAS files and then the compiler will then compile it and put it into the CSSA folder as a regular

60
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,450
CSSA file.

61
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:57,710
Ok so in the SPSS folder we're going to create a new file called Main dot SPSS just like that.

62
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:07,330
And then we're also going to open up the materialize zip file that we just downloaded.

63
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,680
So it's close.

64
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,350
And what we want to do is go into the SAS folder and we want to take these and put them into our SPSS

65
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:26,320
folders so open up Cal appear here and go into SPSS and let's bring these to this folder and this file

66
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,590
over we'll look at those in a second.

67
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,430
And then that's really all we need.

68
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:38,680
We already have the fonts folder for the J.S. we don't need that we already have the J us so we have

69
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:38,950
that.

70
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:46,930
Now let's open up vs code again or go back to vs code and you'll see we have materialized on SPSS.

71
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:53,300
Now basically what this is is just a meeting place for all of the SPSS components.

72
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,050
Each aspect of materialized has its own SPSS file.

73
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,330
For instance the carousel has its own SPSS file with all the SAS and you can see it's using nesting

74
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,650
and all that stuff.

75
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,090
Badges and buttons and you can see there's there's variables and hair and all that stuff.

76
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:19,090
Now normally you don't want to change any of this what you what you can change or what you should change

77
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,640
is the the underscore variables file.

78
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:30,940
And this is where like the primary color is the primary color light primary color dark secondary color

79
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:37,060
you can change these values here and then we have things like the button height if you wanted to make

80
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,780
your standard button height bigger or smaller you could do that.

81
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:48,130
This is all button stuff this is all card stuff the carousel height default is 400 but you could change

82
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,000
that here.

83
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,730
You could change a lot of stuff from here.

84
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,080
So it's really to customize your materialize installation.

85
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,010
All right but we're not and we're not going to do too much here.

86
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,640
We're going to change up the colors a little bit and maybe a couple of other things.

87
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:03,990
All right.

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:14,960
Now what I want to do is now go to Kohala which is buried here and we're going to add a project and

89
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,440
we basically want to just choose our SAS folders so it's going to be in my desktop in the Gallup folder

90
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,100
and then I want to choose the SPSS folder and we're going to open that up.

91
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:32,200
So automatically it finds our SPSS files we have the main file and then materialize.

92
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:39,950
So what I am going to do here is right click and I'm going to say set output path for main dot SPSS

93
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:50,910
and I'm going to I'm going to set it to the CSSA folder to main Dotsie SS and save OK even though it

94
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,730
already exists.

95
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,960
I'm going to say yes.

96
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,600
And now that's going to compile to that file.

97
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,980
This one here that materialize.

98
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:03,370
I'm going to do the same thing I'm going to set the output path to the CSSA folder.

99
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:10,770
And set it to the materialized man Ghodsee SS and save that.

100
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,120
All right.

101
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:19,290
Now if I go back into the folder structure here if we go back into SPSS you'll see that it already compiled

102
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,490
to CSX before I did anything into the SPSS.

103
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:31,340
OK so we don't want the CSSA files in here we want them to go in here to these.

104
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,210
So what we can do is delete the main dot C Ss and also the sort.

105
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,920
This the source maps were not really going to get into that.

106
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,210
Any ways we can disable those too.

107
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,850
But we only want our SPSS files in here so let's delete that as well.

108
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,850
Let's delete this source wrap.

109
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,620
So we should only have these two SAS files and components.

110
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:06,620
All right and if we go to Kohala and we can actually uncheck source wrap for both of these.

111
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:12,740
OK and see how it's set to auto compile that means when we save anything in SAS it'll auto compile to

112
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,240
the CSSA files.

113
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:15,560
All right.

114
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,200
So let's go ahead and click compile

115
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,590
it auto compile anyways.

116
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:32,710
But now if I look in materialize men CSSA this all came from the materialized SAS file.

117
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,110
All right.

118
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:39,440
And this is the file we want to include in our index each team now which we already are anyways so we

119
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,510
don't have to change that.

120
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,550
We don't want to change any of this because we're using the same CSSA files.

121
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,390
It's just being compiled from our SAS.

122
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:47,680
All right.

123
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:55,190
So hopefully this isn't too confusing the set up once we get set up then it's basically just like every

124
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,390
other project except we can use variables and stuff.

125
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:00,790
OK.

126
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,580
So let's open this with our live server.

127
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,990
And I just want to try something here so if we go into our main SPSS file let's set a variable we'll

128
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:28,530
say let's say primary and we'll set that to read and then I just want to say body will say background.

129
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:35,560
This is just a test we'll say background and then we'll set it to the variable of primary and let's

130
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,360
save that

131
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,210
and that should actually get compiled automatically let's look at the main dot CSSA file.

132
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:53,950
Ok so it didn't and I think that's because I closed caller Yeah it's no longer open

133
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:06,590
qualis should be running in order for it to auto compile so just say resave this.

134
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,360
There we go.

135
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,250
OK so koala went ahead and compiled it.

136
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:16,970
Now if I look in my main DOS CSSA file it's just background read because a CSSA file can't have a variable

137
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,320
inside of it.

138
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,320
So now that's our workflow we work in the SAS files but it gets compiled to the CSX.

139
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:25,700
All right.

140
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,160
I'm just going to get rid of this and save and then that background will go away.

141
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:37,190
OK so now we're going to work just like we have been except we're going to use these SPSS files instead

142
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,040
of the CSX.

143
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,260
So in the next video we'll go ahead and we'll get started building our project in creating our markup.
