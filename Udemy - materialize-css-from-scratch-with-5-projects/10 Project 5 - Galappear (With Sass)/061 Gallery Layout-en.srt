1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,310
All right guys.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,950
Now we're going to create the gallery section or the gallery images.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:18,490
So what we'll do is go under the header in the index page and let's say Section main and we'll say Section

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:27,350
class section and then we also give it section Dasch making.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,840
All right so basically in here we're going to have a container and then we're going to have three rows.

6
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,670
So this is going to be row 1.

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,740
So let's say class row.

8
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm also going to give it a class of row Dash 1 and then we're going to have to call them let's say

9
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,810
6.

10
00:00:51,190 --> 00:01:00,340
So medium 6 in let's say hide on small dash only and the reason I'm putting this is because I don't

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,580
want this text to show on small screens.

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:11,800
So this is going to have a class of I Am G content OK it's going to be the content for the image which

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:20,500
will have the H-3 and I'm just using fake words here like Dila gourd for the for the name of the project

14
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:32,410
or whatever it is and then let's do Warum 20 and then we want to go let's see under this column that

15
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:38,510
we just created and we want to do another column 6.

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,520
And then this will be a card.

17
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:50,500
So say does class card it's going to have a card image class.

18
00:01:50,500 --> 00:02:00,030
Inside here we'll have our actual image which is going to be in our I am g folder in the gallery folder

19
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,510
and it's going to be abstract.

20
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,160
One dot J Pag.

21
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,450
All right.

22
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,350
Let's see.

23
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,120
And then underneath the image will have a span.

24
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:27,320
And this is going to have a class of card title and will say Dila Goerge and then under that will have

25
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:34,280
an eight tag and this is going to be a floating button so we're going to do BT and dash floating.

26
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,390
Let's also do

27
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:46,160
Half-Way dash FHB which is going to allow it to basically be like in the middle of the image and the

28
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,060
content of the card.

29
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,380
So Half-Way fab will also do a wave's effect

30
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,420
and will do waves dash light.

31
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,120
Let's do red will make it a red button.

32
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,330
And it's also going to be a motile trigger.

33
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,210
So I'm just going to put that class for now as well.

34
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,990
So quite a few classes.

35
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,990
And then inside here we want an icon.

36
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,350
Whoops.

37
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:23,480
This is actually going to go to abstract one which will be a modal and inside the tag we're going to

38
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,620
have an icon

39
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,460
which will be the Add button.

40
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,920
The ADD icon.

41
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:33,680
All right.

42
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:41,240
And then underneath the card image which ends right here we're going to have the card contents

43
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,470
in the card content is going to have the star ratings.

44
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,960
OK so it's going to be the star icon so we're going to put a paragraph and then just have a bunch of

45
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,690
icons.

46
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:04,630
So not class Tiriel icons and is going to be a star and we're going to just copy this down.

47
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,510
We're going to do five of them.

48
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,140
So let's save that.

49
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,890
And it should look like that.

50
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,580
Now for the body text.

51
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,750
What I'm going to do is create what's called a mixin or actually you know we're going to use a function

52
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,110
a SAS function.

53
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,500
And I wanted to look at the background color and see how dark it is.

54
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:34,330
If it's dark enough then I want it to have white text if it's light then I wanted to have dark text.

55
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:44,830
So the way that we can do this is a go up here and it's a text color function.

56
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:53,780
And to make create a function we can say at function I'm going to call it set text color ok it's going

57
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,860
to take an

58
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,790
see it's going to take in a color

59
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,490
so we put a parameter and then we can do an if statement by saying at if

60
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,560
and we can use a method called lightness.

61
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:26,870
We're going to say if whiteness of the color that's passed in is greater than 50 then we want to return

62
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,720
the color black

63
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,690
OK else.

64
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:47,010
So I want to say at als that we want to return the color white OK.

65
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:59,020
Now we can go into our body and we can say we want the color to be set text color and then what you

66
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,390
pass in the background whatever is being used as the background color which in this case is the primary

67
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,760
color variable.

68
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:15,650
All right so if I save that now the text is white because this is dark enough to have white text the

69
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,960
whiteness is is it's less than 50.

70
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:29,330
If I were to go into my variables and change the the background color to white it's just too white and

71
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,020
save

72
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,530
I guess white isn't a valid option.

73
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,390
Now is not a color for Litan.

74
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,340
All right so let's do.

75
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,150
All right so it's two Teale but let's do Litan

76
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,150
Leitung four which would be really like.

77
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,170
And now you can see the text is dark.

78
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,670
OK so it's going to look at that background color and the text color will change depending on that which

79
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,740
I think is really powerful because then you can change the background color without having to worry

80
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,730
about the next color.

81
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,220
So let's put that back to dark and to save.

82
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,390
And now the text goes back to white.

83
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,560
All right.

84
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:27,220
Now let's add some more SS Actually before we do that let's add the rest of the content here.

85
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:36,470
So we're going to copy let's see for the second row let's just copy this whole row which ends here.

86
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,430
Abse

87
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,540
So grab all that

88
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,130
and this is going to be row to

89
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:58,160
change the class to row to and fro row to where it's going to be reversed.

90
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,730
I want to have the image and stuff on this side and the text on this side.

91
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,720
So I'm going to grab everything that's in this column

92
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:15,640
X yowled will do is take this div this column right here cut it and move it below.

93
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,320
This one

94
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,710
them will change the image too abstract too.

95
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,620
And we're going to change the name to

96
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,950
Al RSA.

97
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:38,600
And if you're wondering where I get these names there was a there's an online fake word generator which

98
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:45,060
I used I'm going to change this abstract to and see what else.

99
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,110
Right here.

100
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,480
Want to change this to Allergist's as well.

101
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,940
So let's save that.

102
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,330
And there we go.

103
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,100
All right.

104
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,240
And don't worry about it we can't see the stars.

105
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,430
Don't worry about that yet.

106
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,550
We'll fix that.

107
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,360
And now the last one is going to have the same format as the first row.

108
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:10,210
So again let's copy the first row which ends here.

109
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,810
See here.

110
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:20,450
Copy that will go below the second row and paste that in and change this to row 3.

111
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,200
Change this to three.

112
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:30,960
And as far as the title it's going to be record.

113
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,470
Abstract 3.

114
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:44,560
This will be abstract 3 and will change the title here and save.

115
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:44,920
All right.

116
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,770
There we go.

117
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:58,820
So now we're going to go to the C Ss and let's add a class for our out of style for image content.

118
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,700
And I'm actually going to display Flack's here.

119
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:12,850
We say display flex and flex direction will be call them.

120
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,480
So it's going to go vertical.

121
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,950
And then we'll justify to the center

122
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:27,060
and we'll set the height to 300 pixels.

123
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,380
OK so that's just what it did is it move the text down into the middle here.

124
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:33,820
All right.

125
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,420
Now the card content which is this.

126
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,140
I want that to have a color of the primary color.

127
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,990
So we're going to use that variable

128
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,210
so save and now the stars are green.

129
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,070
All right so in the next video will do is implement the Modals we want to click on these buttons and

130
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,050
have a mode open for each one.

131
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,960
We'll also add the footer.

132
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,620
All right so I'll see in the next lecture.
