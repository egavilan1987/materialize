1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,590
All right guys.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:07,720
Now we're going to add the for real quick I'm going to grab this format from materialize.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:19,170
SS If we go to components her rather than typing it out I'm going to grab this and we'll go and paste

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,550
that in.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,640
Let's see we'll put it right under the section.

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:28,550
All right.

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,960
Now if I saved that and we take a look.

8
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:36,120
It has basically no color to it.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:48,980
What I'm going to do is go to the main door SPSS and let's add for the page for her.

10
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,220
Let's set the background color to the secondary color.

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,340
Remember we made it a dark gray.

12
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:05,390
So I'll say secondary color and then the photo copyright which we can nest in here because we're using

13
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:11,420
SAS so we can say for Dash copyright.

14
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,550
We're going to set that background

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,890
to the secondary color white which is the variable that we created

16
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,560
OK we created it in the materialize variable's file.

17
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,130
So let's save that and there we go.

18
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,410
So there's our footer.

19
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,080
You can see the colors have changed.

20
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,640
I'm just going to change.

21
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,840
SEE.

22
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,350
Let's go to our index.

23
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,420
Let's change these links.

24
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,410
So this will be abstract

25
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,490
and what was the other ones logos.

26
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,350
And gaming.

27
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,730
And we'll get rid of this last one here.

28
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,750
OK.

29
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:31,780
And then instead of for our content we'll just say about me all right and we'll change that copyright

30
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,360
tax will say 2018

31
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,470
and gallop here.

32
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,480
And we'll just leave that that's fine.

33
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,490
All right so there's a fourth.

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,270
Now it's let's do the Modals.

35
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,710
OK so first let's initialize our modals down here.

36
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:05,980
Let's put a comment here and see a net side now and then we'll say net motile and we do that by taking

37
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:14,830
class modal and calling Daut moto.

38
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:22,020
So if we look at the first one the first row here the first whatever gallery image

39
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,480
and we look at the link it goes to abstract 1.

40
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,420
It also has a modal trigger class so that's all set.

41
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:37,780
Now we just need to create the Modals So we're going to go down to the bottom right below the water

42
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,520
and let's say modal one

43
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:53,400
and we're going to give this an ID of abstract 1 in the class of modal

44
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,320
OK and then we'll do our modal content

45
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:13,570
inside here let's put in age for the title which is Dila Gore and then our image with the class of responsive

46
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,800
Dasch I am g.

47
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:23,290
And this is going to be the image slash gallery slash abstract one.

48
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:33,980
Jay peg and then under that we're going to put some text and when I say warm 20 tab OK and then under

49
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,560
this div we're going to have our motile for

50
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:49,620
which is going to have our star rating so I'm going to copy this paragraph with all the stars and we'll

51
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,420
put that right here.

52
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,960
OK so let's copy that and then if we click on this it opens the motile Now notice that the text is white

53
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,560
we can't see it.

54
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:12,620
So I'm I'm just going to give the motiveless static color so let's go it's say class motile and will

55
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:21,380
say color 3:33 and you guys can experiment if you want if you want to create a variable for it whatever

56
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,570
you want to do is fine.

57
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,310
There we go.

58
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,660
So that's our moto.

59
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,360
Now let's do the other two.

60
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,910
So they're going to be formatted the same way they're just going to have different content so I'll copy

61
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,130
that.

62
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,530
So this will be modal too.

63
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:43,860
It will be abstract to will change the image will change the title to al-Ras

64
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,920
and let's see I think we can do half stars as well.

65
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,220
Let me check something here.

66
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:11,190
Yeah Star half so I font is Star underscore half.

67
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,460
So let's actually make it a little more realistic and we'll take the second one and let's do star underscore

68
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,730
half right here.

69
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,210
Okay.

70
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:32,280
And then we'll go down to the motile so modal to do star half save that and then we go and see it as

71
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,570
a half star.

72
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,460
Open up the.

73
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,170
Good now do is copy

74
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,260
motile one and we'll do the third one.

75
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:59,220
Abstract three abstract three and let's see if we want to change the title to reconned.

76
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:07,280
So now these two should work so that one and that one good.

77
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:12,570
So now we're going to do as the scroll fire which is actually pretty easy to do.

78
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:20,820
What we'll do is go down to the javascript and say scroll fire.

79
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:33,860
So we need to create our options which is going to be an array of objects with a selector.

80
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:41,060
Now remember we have selectors we have Row 1 2 and 3 so we want to select row 1 and then the offset

81
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:49,850
is going to be 50 K 50 from the top and then that takes a callback.

82
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,500
I mean just make this wider

83
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:02,930
it's so offset 50 callback function

84
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:18,330
and this takes an element and then we just want to fade it in so we can say materialize Daut fade an

85
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:26,260
image and we can pass in here like that.

86
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,060
All right.

87
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:35,250
So the first one is is basically always going to be displayed because it's at the top.

88
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,390
But the other two we don't want displayed unless we're at a certain point.

89
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,290
OK.

90
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:48,060
Which I believe we want this one at 300 offset and this one at 400 I think that's what I had working

91
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:54,860
so we'll copy this piece of copy that and put a comma here.

92
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,770
Paste that in and we'll say row two.

93
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,550
We'll have an offset of 300.

94
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,590
That's when we want it to fade in.

95
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:12,260
And then the next one row three will have an offset of 400 OK.

96
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,380
And then we want to go under the options array Whoops.

97
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:28,950
And we want to call materialize dots scroll fire and pass in our options.

98
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,790
So let's save that.

99
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,030
All right so let's see.

100
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:43,400
They do appear even the first one is going to fade in but the second one.

101
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,950
What am I missing here.

102
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,010
Did I not change the row

103
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,060
see row 3 row to

104
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:22,800
oh you know what the reason for that is because we actually need to set the opacity to zero to begin

105
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,680
with.

106
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:35,840
So in our main CSSA SPSS we're going to say row 1 row 2 and

107
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:46,500
row 3 are going to set the opacity to zero to begin with because we're feeding them in.

108
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,760
So let's save and then reload.

109
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,440
OK.

110
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,590
So we're already at offset 50 right.

111
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,330
Which is the first one are already at this.

112
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,180
So it fades in.

113
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,760
Now the other two the opacity is set to zero.

114
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:10,820
But when we hit 300 RHO to should then fade in K when we hit 400 row 3 should fade and good.

115
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,270
So that that's working out good.

116
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,620
Awesome.

117
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,280
So that's all set.

118
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,060
And let's check out the responsiveness.

119
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:27,500
Make sure that looks good and that still should work even if it's responsive.

120
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,310
So even if you are on a mobile device that would work.

121
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,270
All right so we're getting there the last thing we really need to do is just the other two pages which

122
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,070
are pretty much identical just different content.

123
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,210
All right so that's what we'll do in the next video.
