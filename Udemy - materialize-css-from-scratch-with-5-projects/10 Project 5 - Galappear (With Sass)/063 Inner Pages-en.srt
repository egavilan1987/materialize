1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,600
All right guys so we're pretty much there now we just want to add the other pages so I'm going to create

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:16,650
in the route here to new pages one is Logos daughter aged himself and then one is not a folder we want

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:24,810
to file one is going to be gaming aged him now and then I'm going to copy everything from the index

4
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,850
file to logo's except we're going to change some of the content.

5
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:41,610
We're also going to take the class active off of abstract and put it onto the logos ally and then down

6
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,240
here let's change up this stuff so see.

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,390
So the first one the name is going to be Strozzi is

8
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:03,730
and will leave that text the the image is going to be in the gallery and it's going to be logo one will

9
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,470
change the title again.

10
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,810
Strozzi strides these are now and let's change this to star half

11
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:21,040
and then the second one is going to be the logo to

12
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:30,500
and the name is going to be Unix.

13
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,680
It will keep.

14
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,840
I will change the name here as well to Unix.

15
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:39,950
And then the third one

16
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,200
is going to be hosting

17
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,460
changed the image to logo 3.

18
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,730
Change that to hosting and that should be good.

19
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:05,540
Now we're going to go down to the Modals and let me see did I change the IDs.

20
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,080
Let's see.

21
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:10,720
No we didn't.

22
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,840
So idea should be logo 3.

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,700
Not the idea but the graph.

24
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,840
This one should be logo too.

25
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,770
And this one should be logo one

26
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,950
and then we'll change up our modals So this will be logo one changed the image.

27
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,650
I know it's tedious but we want it to make sense.

28
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,190
I think that as a star half.

29
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,010
So this one here will be logo's to

30
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,730
you next.

31
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,170
I think that had five stars.

32
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,470
And then this one will be logo three

33
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,040
all right.

34
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,670
So let's save that see if we can go to logo's and other javascript and d.j queries all the same.

35
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,360
So we're still getting the scroll of fire and it's click on them all.

36
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,720
Oh good.

37
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,420
We scroll down we get the next one we get the hosting.

38
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,920
Good.

39
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,600
So now we just need the gaming.

40
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:37,160
So I'm going to copy everything here and go to gaming h Tim Allen paces then go to the top.

41
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,970
Let's change the active class.

42
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:48,070
We'll take it off of logos and put it on to gaming and then we're going to change the rows.

43
00:03:48,140 --> 00:04:00,400
So for names we have Clauss costs you know some weird names here Clauss CEO.

44
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,380
We're going to change

45
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,210
the image to gaming one

46
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,750
the HGF here this will be gaming on

47
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,180
this on we'll be

48
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,510
gaming to and for the name.

49
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,280
We have voice Flyn

50
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,130
to change the name care as well.

51
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,640
That I change both names here.

52
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,360
No I didn't.

53
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,420
This one should be Colacello.

54
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:52,750
All right so road to this will be good gaming too.

55
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,090
OK.

56
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:00,870
The third one here is rendang for the name

57
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,280
change the image in the trough

58
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:20,860
right.

59
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:27,740
So now we'll go down to the Modals and change the ID to gaming one

60
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,180
change the image and search the title

61
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:51,980
gaming to title title was one voice when

62
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,150
came into to that.

63
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:57,880
Good.

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,530
Oh we're going to change this

65
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,020
game in three and then the title for this was run Dan

66
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,070
and we should be good.

67
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,320
So let's go to gaming.

68
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,930
There we go.

69
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,020
Odal works skirl fireworks

70
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,390
awesome so that's it guys.

71
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,020
We are done.

72
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:43,150
Now if you were to say deploy this to a web host or something some kind of server you would not need

73
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,260
to deploy the SPSS.

74
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,150
This is strictly for your development all the SAS.

75
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,690
This is all getting compiled to these two CSSA files.

76
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,660
This is all you need so you can leave this behind.

77
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,840
This is just for your own on your own development machine.

78
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,600
Ok just to let you know that the browser does not.

79
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,310
It does it doesn't recognize SAS files.

80
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,280
There's no point in uploading those.

81
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,540
OK so just leave those out.

82
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,880
So we've reached the end of the course.

83
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,040
I really hope you guys enjoyed it if you went through the whole thing and built all five projects.

84
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,080
Congratulations.

85
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,210
I know it's a lot of work it's a lot of typing and hopefully you can take the skills that you've learned

86
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:31,390
and you can create your own projects and you can get clients and create user interfaces and Web sites

87
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,850
that they're happy with and you can use this in your career and better yourself as a developer.

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,580
But I want to sincerely thank you for purchasing the course and sticking through it and that's it.

89
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,240
Thanks guys.

90
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,170
Hopefully I will see you in the next one.
